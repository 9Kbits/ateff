#	home_court: all characters in the AI's home court, including prisoners, and characters currently away (wards, prisoners, etc)

#	sub_realm: all characters below the AI's employer

#	rivals: your rivals plus any character you have an opinion modifier with 'crime = yes' set (the same set of characters the 'is_foe' trigger evaluates)
