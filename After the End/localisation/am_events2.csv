EVTDESC_salvage_peaceful;Mixed among the local residents in [From.GetName], you see the occasional soldier wearing the colors of [From.Holder.GetTitledFirstName]. Fortunately, the soldiers seem to be ensuring that order is maintained and the locals allow you to pass without conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_violence;Hostile Locals;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_violence;Your continued presence in [From.GetName] has drawn the ire of the local peasantry, and you are now confronted by a disorganized mob of angry villagers. They may not be well armed, and they're certainly not well trained...\n\n...but there are a lot of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_flee;We should turn back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_salvage_flee;Your Salvage Expedition is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_salvage_continue;Your Salvage Expedition continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_fight;We can fight our way through!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_fightwarband;They'll back down from a vulgar display of power!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_violence_bribe;Peasants like silver, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_drivenout;Driven from [From.From.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_drivenout;Hordes of angry local villagers have driven you from their lands, ending your Salvage Expedition. If it makes you feel better, tell yourself you left to avoid shedding THEIR blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_agent;Competing Salvager;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_agent;During your expedition to [From.GetName], you encounter an agent of an unknown lord who shares your faith. He appears to be scouting new salvage sites for his master, in direct competition with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent;May the best salvager win!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent_research;Direct him to a promising site nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_agent_intrigue;Make him disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_collapse;Collapse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_collapse;You hoped the wooden reinforcement beams would be enough, but one of them slipped. The centuries have not been kind to the crumbling concrete and rusty iron, and the whole unstable mess is coming down around you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_collapse_flee;Run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_collapse_brave;I won't let debris stand in my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_collapse_plan;I planned for this risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

recent_salvage_desc;This character has recently gone on a Salvage Expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
preparing_expedition;Preparing Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x
preparing_expedition_desc;This character is preparing to go on a Salvage Expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_value;Salvage in [From.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_worthless;Your expedition has turned up very little valuable salvage. You have explored many ruined buildings, and everywhere you look you find the ruins picked clean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless;Disappointing.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless_compete;Someone has been here before me...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_worthless_research;There is another site nearby we could check.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_moderate;Your expedition has turned up a few items of useful salvage. In the ruined buildings and tunnels you have uncovered several artifacts of the Old World, though you have not yet found the kind of major prize you were hoping for.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_moderate;At least I found something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_moderate_research;Hawk these trinkets, I know of another site.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe;Your men have discovered a large metal box beneath the ruins of a long-forgotten structure in [From.GetName]. The strongbox is corroded but still intact. Who knows what mysteries or treasures of the Old World are sealed within it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe;I'll know soon, crack it open!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_safe_patient;Have your tinker open it carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_item;Salvage;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_scraps;You have found scraps of Old World artifacts, but none of them are especially well preserved. There are objects that may have once been used for cooking or as craftsmen's tools, but it's hard to tell with the corrosion and decay of the centuries. They might be worth a few gold pieces to the right buyer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_coins;Your men have discovered a cache of corroded coins from the Old World. Their coins were inexplicably made out of base metals rather than gold or silver, dramatically reducing their value as working currency. Still, they might be worth a few gold pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_glassware;You have discovered a long-hidden supply of Old World glassware. Unlike iron objects which have mostly been consumed by rust, many glass objects have survived. You need but wipe off the centuries and you'll have finely polished Old World artifacts that artisans today cannot replicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_machinery;Amongst a wreck of disintegrated iron, you find a fabulously preserved piece of Old World machinery. Though stained with rust, the beautiful object itself does not seem to have rusted. It is about three feet across, irregularly shaped, with a half-dozen holes perfectly cut partway through it. It is constructed from a metal that is lighter than iron.\n\nThis will be a great addition to your great hall, or part of a shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_smash;Your men take to the box with hammers, and succeed in ripping the door off after a few hours. Whether it was the rough handling of the box, the ravages of time and moisture, or simple bad luck, you find nothing of value within.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_jewellery;Treasures!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_jewellery;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a variety of Old World jewellery, glittering with gold, silver, and precious stones. The craftsmanship is finer and more intricate than what modern goldsmiths can produce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_ledger;Papers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_ledger;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several old folios bound with crumbling dark leather and stacks of identical green paper strips with the rune "20" in the corners. It's amazing how well the safe has preserved its contents, the seal must have been perfect. The folios are filled with line after line of numbers and symbols.\n\nYou would be rich, if paper currency were still in use.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_photos;Paintings?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_photos;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of dozens of tiny paintings, discolored with age but extremely detailed. The paintings depict a family of people in the Old World. How these paintings were produced is a mystery to you, as the canvas is very thin and there are no visible brush strokes.\n\nThe cracked and crumbling condition of the paintings makes you think they are unlikely to last long after being removed from the sealed safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_musicbox;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a collection of small ornate boxes about the size of your palm. Each box contains a cylinder with patterns of tiny protrusions, adjacent to an array of metal tines of various lengths. You twist the small crank on the side of a box, it begins to plink out an Old World melody that probably hasn't been heard for centuries.\n\nThis will be a hit among my courtiers... a song for the ages!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_machinery;Machinery!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_electric;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a complicated piece of Old World technology, the purpose of which is a mystery to you. The artifact features several prominent finely blown glass bubbles, mechanical innards, and thin flexible metal strands that shed greenish-black powder when disturbed.\n\nYou are unable to get the artifact to do anything. There seems to be something missing that you don't understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_safe_firearm;Firepower!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_firearm;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a long metal tube with various bits of metal and brittle wood attached to it. You've heard stories that Old World knights used such devices to produce fire from nothing, but it's hard to believe you're seeing one for yourself. Though the safe has preserved it well, you will have to handle it gently and be unable to fix it if it breaks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_typewriter;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Underwood" written on it in gleaming gold-leaf letters. Rows of thumbnail-sized metal disks are attached to the complicated mechanical innards of the machine, each labelled with a unique rune.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of recovered tech, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_calculator;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a well preserved piece of Old World technology with the word "Arithmometer" engraved in the metal in a flowing script. The machine is dominated by a heavy horizontal metal cylinder, with numerals visible through gaps in the metal shell and a hefty metal hand-crank on the side.\n\nAside from its beauty as a piece of tech art, this machine would probably be very useful if you could figure out how to use and maintain it...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_watch;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a golden, palm-sized clamshell disk, attached to an intricate chain of gold. When you open the clamshell you see that one side is labelled with the numerals I through XII, and you realize that the artifact is an Old World timekeeping device.\n\nIt would be a stylish accessory for any lord, but it would be even more useful if you could understand its workings and restore its function.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_optics;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: a segmented set of brass tubes with several curved internal mirrors and smoothly bulging disks of polished glass. The tools and knowledge to craft such a device have been lost, but you recognize it as an Old World version of today's spyglass.\n\nYou will be able to see things from a great distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_safe_textbooks;The safe door finally opens, and you can see the contents: several stacks of thick books. They have been sealed away from the ravages of the weather, but the centuries have still taken their toll on their brittle brown pages.\n\nWith luck, a scholar fluent in Old World languages will be able to extract useful information from the books before they crumble into dust.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_result;Salvage Expedition ends;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_poor;Not all Salvage Expeditions end in success. Sometimes the recovered artifacts are badly damaged, sometimes they are worthless, sometimes there isn't anything to salvage because the area has been picked clean, and sometimes dangerous circumstances interrupt the expedition.\n\nThis is one of those times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_poor;Until next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_medium;You have returned from your Salvage Expedition with baubles and artifacts of the Old World. Although you did not find a tech prize truly worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s favor, at least you didn't return empty handed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_keep;I'll keep the salvage for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_sell;Someone will buy these trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_medium_donate;I will donate these artifacts to the techpriests for study.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_result_good;You have returned from your Salvage Expedition with an exciting tech prize, worthy of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s favor. Your court is buzzing with word of your success, and the techpriests are already coming to you with requests to examine your prize. It remains to be seen whether you can return the artifact to a functional state.\n\nThis will surely bring you fame, power, and understanding of the old world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_result_study;I must study and repair my prize.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_repair_prize;The Past Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_firearm;After weeks of study, your armorers have finally restored your Old World firearm to working condition! Much of the wood body had to be replaced, but the metal parts were functional. The charges required to operate the weapon are in extremely short supply, as many of those found alongside the weapon were dangerously unstable and your armorers do not yet know how to construct additional charges.\n\nYou will be a fearsome and inspiring figure on the battlefield!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_firearm;This is my boomstick!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_calculator;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your numeric calculating machine to working condition! You are still learning how to operate it: you enter numerals by sliding the levers into the correct positions, then turn the heavy crank and the machine produces the result of addition in mere seconds.\n\nThis will make it much easier to keep track of the rents and taxes that are owed to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_watch;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your gilded timekeeping device to working condition! Once the device is activated by inserting a key and twisting it, it begins to emit a soft ticking sound and the slender arms move smoothly across its face. You must handle the artifact carefully, because many of its small parts are irreplaceable.\n\nYou will be aided in any tasks that require precise measurement of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_typewriter;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your lettering machine to working condition! Their fingertips are black from handling powdered charcoal and other attempts at creating a useful ink. Study of the device has revealed much about the prowess of Old World smiths.\n\nYou are now able to issue decrees in the neat, authoritative letters of Underwood himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_optics;After weeks of study, your tinkers have finally restored your brass spyglass to working condition! Polishing with a soft cloth has brought the shine back to the metal, while the glass optics have retained their nearly perfect transparency. When you look through the eyepiece you are able to see things at a distance others could only dream about, even gazing at the Moon and stars as the people of the Old World must have.\n\nThe potential military advantages are enormous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_textbooks;After weeks of study, your scholars have learned many things about your collection of pre-calamity books. Several of the books have have fallen to pieces during transport or study, but those that survived are providing valuable insight into medicine, engineering, and other topics.\n\nMore study will reveal additional secrets of the old world!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_salvage_fail_prize;Unsolved Mysteries;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_salvage_study_fail;Despite weeks of effort you have failed to restore your salvaged prize to a useful state. Your assistants don't possess the knowledge or the tools to help you accomplish this task, and your efforts only seem to be causing additional damage. Major portions of the prize are damaged or missing, and there may be some mystical component required to make the device function that is not available to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_keep;I can still display it as art.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_sell;Someone will buy it from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_salvage_study_learn;The real prize is the knowledge I've gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TXT_bequeth_lost;The artifact is lost to the ages;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_firearm_battle;Take Aim!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_firearm_battle;An arrow glances off your armor as the battle is joined, the air fills with a flurry of battle cries, and you hear the ringing sound of steel on steel.\n\nYour foes surge towards you, but you raise your Old World firearm to single out a looming warrior leading the charge. You pull the trigger and the warrior is felled with a deafening blast of light and smoke, his armor useless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_fire;None dare to oppose the Firebringer!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_thunder;Fools, I am the Thunderhand!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_marksman;My marksmanship is perfect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_firearm_battle_default;Run from me, cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_typewriter_history;Storytelling;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_typewriter_history;Sometimes you feel the urge to use your Old World typewriter to write things beyond the normal decrees, proclamations, and correspondence. Perhaps history will remember you more favorably if your thoughts on the events of the day are recorded in your own neatly machine-lettered words.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_record;My dynasty will be remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_poet;I'll tell a rousing story.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_typewriter_history_square;I will use it only for affairs of state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_calculator_taxes;Death and Taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_calculator_taxes;It may be boring, but it is a crucial task for any [Root.GetTitle] to ensure that his expected tax revenue matches the rents paid by his vassals. Your Old World Arithmometer has made it much easier for you to do just that. You feel much more confident calculating the expected contents of your treasury, and can ensure that the numbers reported by your advisers are accurate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_shrewd;This enhances my reputation for shrewdness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_machine;I'm more machine than man!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_calculator_taxes_default;Some of my vassals are short a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_watch_smooth;Precision in All Things;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_watch_smooth;Since you acquired your Old World pocket watch, you feel like things have been running like... well, clockwork. You are able to bring precision and confidence to any issue you face. While others struggle with primitive sundials, you keep your stylish ticking companion with you at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_style;Plus, it goes with everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_carriage;I make the carriages run on time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_watch_smooth_default;Well, I am pretty great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_telescope_stargaze;Watch the Skies;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_telescope_stargaze;Sometimes you take your Old World telescope to a high tower late at night, and gaze through it at the sky. Some might consider it frivolous, but you find it relaxing to see the Moon and wandering stars in a way few have since the calamity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_astro;I'll study the wandering stars, also known as planets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_military;My telescope should be reserved for scouting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_telescope_stargaze_calm;It's very calming.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_textbooks_medical;Intense Study;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_textbooks_medical;You have been spending some time studying your collection of Old World books. You are not fully fluent in the language, but you have determined that one of the books is a manual of Old World treatments for human disease. Though some of the words are arcane and confusing, there are many useful anatomical diagrams and descriptions of healing techniques.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_wound;This will help me heal my wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_textbooks_medical_ill;This will help me cure my illness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

His name is [From.GetTitledFirstName], and he claims to be a wandering merchant of the Consumerist faith. He trades in luxuries and specializes in acquiring rare and unique artifacts.\n\nAfter all, who doesn't need a bit more luxury in their life?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
