EVTNAMECONSUMER1;The Rise of Consumerism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCONSUMER1;A prophet has arisen, proclaiming that the Old World was struck down, not by Jesus, the Atom, or the Founding Fathers, but by the Almighty Dollar for neglecting the temples they called Malls, improperly performing the ritual of the Shopping, and not giving Him tribute for every new Product he created, and that He will soon destroy the world again unless all Americans follow these rites. Many have came before him, preaching similar doctrines but attracting few followers, for the ruins of Old America are littered with books and signs advertising marvelous products that will cure all ills and bring true happiness. But this prophet's oratory has given him tens of thousands of followers, who are now spreading their faith across America by his words and by the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
