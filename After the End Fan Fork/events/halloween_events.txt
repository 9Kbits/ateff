#Happy Halloween!
#Event Sequence:
	#You select from one of three outfits. These outfits differ depending on religion, so there are actually six in total.
	#You go from door to door and attempt to scare people.
		#Success depends on costume choice and traits - Wroth and Cruel rulers do a better job, while Craven and Shy rulers can't quite do it.
		#A successful scare campaign gives you prestige and gold, while an unsuccessful one makes you lose prestige and yields less gold.
	#After you are done, you journey back to your palace... only to have a mysterious spooky encounter! (One is disabled those with Supernatural events turned off.)
	#Four different scare events:
		#You encounter a witch coven and are offered a magic potion that will "bring you success".
			#You can take the potion willingly, or refuse. Refusal prompts the witches to try and force-feed you the potion.
				#Breaking free is more likely if you are physically strong and less likely if you are physically weak.
			#If you take the potion willingly, the potion has a 75% chance of giving you a positive outcome.
				#Positive effects include the addition of Shrewd, Brawny, Groomed, or temporary health boost (most likely).
				#Negative effects include the addition of Dull, Frail, Uncouth, or a temporary health malus (most likely).
			#Taking the potion unwillingly reverses these odds.
		#You encounter a masked killer!
			#You can choose to flee in terror or stand your ground.
				#Fleeing in terror has a 50% chance of fully escaping, 40% chance of being severely injured, and a 10% chance of dying outright.
				#Fighting back likelihood is dependent on traits, obviously. All things being equal, you have a higher chance of being injured.
		#You make it home... only to encounter a spooky ghost girl in your basement! (Unavailable if you have Supernatural events.)
			#You can choose to approach the ghost kindly or attempt to drive it out forcefully.
				#There is a 50% chance that the ghost is actually a lonely and misunderstood spirit.
					#Treating it kindly will put it at peace, giving you piety and giving you the kind trait.
					#Trying to drive it out forcefully will turn the spirit hostile and scar you for life, giving you the Paranoid or Lunatic traits.
				#On the other hand, there is a 50% chance that the ghost really is a malevolent spirit.
					#Treating it kindly in this case will leave you physically and mentally damaged for your hubris.
					#Trying to drive it out forcefully will succeed, giving you prestige and the Proud trait.
		#This is the more "normal" one. You just make it home and have a terrible nightmare about your future.
			#You can choose to take the dream seriously, which can give you the Paranoid trait or the Ambitious trait, along with the Stressed trait.
			#You can choose to disregard the dream, which avoids the chance of giving you Stressed but can give you Content or Trusting.
	#Along with these four "scare" events, you can instead have a few more mundane ending events:
		#During your walk home, you come across a starving child. You can choose to give them some of your Halloween gold, or jealously hoard it. (affected by your traits etc)
		#A passerby is freaked out by your costume (if you chose a more intimidating one) and flees in terror. This gives you some prestige.
		#You yourself are scared by someone else's costume. This makes you lose prestige.
		#You simply arrive home and nothing remarkable happens. This is the "default" ending event.
	#Regardless of what happens, Halloween ends the next day and you gain prestige.
