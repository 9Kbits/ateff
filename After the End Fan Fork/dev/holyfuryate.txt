Dryhad's Holy Fury Changelog

HFP_pregnancy_events.txt
-"Chance of Churching after first pregnancy" for Catholic and Ursuline
-Vision baby chain limited to vanilla options but should be expanded (e.g. Mormon, Cult of Saints, etc.)

HF_sway_events.txt
-Various events here check religion and sympathy traits, need to be filled out

HF_religion_events.txt
-Changed Aztec to Mesoamerican Group for sacrifice image
-Sympathy events, need to be filled out
-Haruspicy, removed Hellenic, maybe add something
-Astrology, replaced Hellenic with Neomayan
-Secret Hellenic event removed
-Just completely deleted the entire Roman Empire chain.
-Oh gods this on_startup thing for Cosmopolitan/Dogmatic oh gods oh gods oh gods (TODO)
-Province sacrifice event for Mictlantec
-Irminsul/Great Pillar events for different pagans, could be removed entirely or refluffed
-Destroying the Irminsul requires some more investigation and replication
-African rite of passage for Afro-Syncretics
--This also includes the face paint which maybe we don't want?

HF_bloodline_events.txt
-Stuff with Hindu castes removed
-Sympathy for bloodline founder religion still needs to be done
-Removed Teuta's bloodline events
-Theologian and Zealot bloodlines need to be filled out for new religions
-Alexander the Great and Ashoka bloodline events removed, could be used as a template for any number of pre-Event figures but you can do that yourself
-Mystics can be a heretic for Christians, Old World Cultists, and Latter Day Saints and we need new heresies for stuff like Anabaptists and Atomicists but I'm sure this won't break anything.

HFP_religious_events.txt
-Pope wants land in Missouri; might want to pare this back a bit to avoid an overlarge Papacy (AtE duchies are larger than vanilla at least in this area).
-Event HFP.23027 "African rulers can pick a random Abrahamic sympathy": I have no idea where this originates but I removed Islam from it. We probably don't need it at all?
-Event for removing a Hellenic province when the rule was turned off removed even though it was probably safe due to date trigger.

HFP_realm_events.txt
-Entire file blanked. We can make setting-appropriate versions of some of this stuff but it will essentially need to be rewritten from scratch.

HFP_random_flavor_events.txt
-There's an event which adds random freckles! I removed the dangling reference to Uyghur culture but we may need to examine how this interacts with diversity (and maybe integrate it with the diversity event?).
-Left-handedness event, in vanilla Christians and Muslims think it's sinful. Changed to Christians and LDS, but maybe want to rethink the religious aspect in the context of the mod's religions because it's kinda weird.
-Byzantine commander events left untouched because I don't think they can do any damage, but find out what triggers them.

HFP_holy_order_events.txt
-Removed everything that referenced vanilla holy orders.
-The only remaining event in this file is HFP.44002 (and notification event HFP.44003) "Holy Order decides their liege is unfit to rule over them"

HF_crusade_events.txt
-Removed Fourth Crusade. Will require much redesign.
-Removed Northern Crusade. Will require slightly less redesign but still more than I'm planning on doing here.

HFP_eldership_events.txt
-Removed some variable event images, we can maybe play around with this later
-Removed references to Baltic and West African paganism wrt starting with Eldership, replace with whoever gets ancestor worship

hfp_duel_events.txt
-Jain changed to Anabaptist.

HFP_crusade_flavour.txt
-I'm telling the AI to found Crusader States in Tidewater, Long Island, East Susquehanna, and Connecticut ok bye
-Sympathy traits for all AtE religions
-Caravan event divided up, we will want to revisit this with e.g. special items for American Native or Old World Cultist, both are currently in a "misc" group together using the Zoroastrian pool.
-Event HFP.42208 "A little group of faithful" has a lot of potential; vanilla finds Miaphysites in Africa and Nestorians in The Orient with a fallback to ROOT (which will presumably be Catholic?). For now, we find Anabaptists in the rust belt and Anglicans in the northeast, but let's see if we can dig deeper.
-Event HFP.42212 targets AtE Catholic Holy Orders, expand this if we add more
-Shephards' Crusade event chain removed for now, rewrite as necessary

HF_alternate_start_events.txt
-Holy orders activate on RNW. Including UEL?
