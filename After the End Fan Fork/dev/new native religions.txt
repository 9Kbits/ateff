peyotist_DESC;Peyotism is a syncretic religion that combines Christian monotheism and morals with indigenous spirituality and practices. Peyotists believe that a single divine being known as the Great Spirit personally guides the fates of everything and everyone in Creation. Peyotists believe that one can directly communicate with and recieve blessings from the Great Spirit through the use of peyote, or "the holy sacrament", during special ceremonies held at specific times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Holy sites: for now just keep them the same as Ghost Dance, maybe change the one far out west with one in Comancheria or something, idk

Traditional native religion: based on concept of Manitou, with the Seven Flames prophecy thrown in for appropriate post-apoc flavor.
Holy sites: Duluth (Big Manitou Falls), Manitoulin Island, wherever Whiteshell Provincial Park is, northwestern corner of James Bay, and that one county in northwest Michigan. May adjust later depending on how things go
