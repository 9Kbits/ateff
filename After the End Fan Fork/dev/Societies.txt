SOCIETIES:

Four types:
*Religious/Monastic
*Academic
*Sports/Outdoors
*Other

RELIGIOUS/MONASTIC (INCOMPLETE)
(NOTE: All monastic societies will use vanilla mechanics unless stated otherwise. Not every religion or religious group needs one of these.)
*Albertian Order of St. Leibowitz - Catholic monastic order, replacing the Benedictines from vanilla
*If we don't turn the Salvation Army into a merc company/holy order, it can be the name of the Evangelical monastic society. Otherwise, find a different name. (Orthodox mechanics from vanilla)
*Port over Hindu society from vanilla, perhaps rename it to reflect Arya Samaj flavor
*We could probably borrow the Buddhist society mechanics from vanilla and repurpose it for a Gaian monastic order - name TBD
*Chabad - religious society for Jews. Available to all Orthodox Jews and zealous Reform Jews.
  *Powers would have to be tweaked significantly, as many things, like the idea of celibacy, wouldn't work when transferred to Judaism.
  *Potential focus on the Kabbalah, but we'd have to make them a little closer to the Hermetics for that to really work.
*We could probably use one for the Americanists, Atomicists, and Consumerists, but I can't think of anything right now.
*Cetic "Imperial Court" society, incorporating the current "pilgrimage" events (and thus freeing up pilgrimages for the Oregon Trail etc.) and potentially offering a third path to removing the figurehead trait. Some events may be left as is to prevent this society from becoming effectively mandatory for all Cetics, however.

Afro-Syncretic society: 
If√° society - available to Santeria, Candomble, and maybe Voodoo and Tres Potencias. Powers and quests TBD

ACADEMIC:
Ivy League, replacing the Hermetics from Vanilla
Rename ingredients to chemicals
Rename theorem papers to tests
Rename scrying to research/something else
Rename horoscopes to standardized tests
Rename magnum opus to master thesis
Rename hermetic art to specialty
Change "alchemy" for "chemistry" or "medicine" in most instances
Change astrology to psychology or something

SPORTS/OUTDOORS:
Sportist society - check the Google Doc, it's all in there. We'll basically implement it like that, but we may have to come up with some additional powers for it.
Scouts society - based on Boy Scouts of America (Scouts of America??). (Maybe we won't do this)

OTHER:
Men in Black - replaces Assassins. I already have most of the flavor written up for them, it's the implementation that was getting me
Potential rework of the banking mechanic to use societies instead (would prefer building it on top of the existing stuff instead of removing what we have)
Potential society for Overseas Traders (We might do this as an offmap instead) - Combine this with the above idea: the society branch is integrated with the bankers and affected by the status of the overseas offmap.
