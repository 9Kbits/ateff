Okay, and starting event for ashura loc (note - you don’t need to code in anything other than this or the above - I’ll get you full path and loc when I wake up)
“The month of Muharram is upon us, and the memory of Imam Hussein and his sacrifice still burns bright among the Imamite/Alawiyya (is it possible to code the loc so it’s different for religion? If not, just say “Shia” instead) faithful. In particular, commemoration ceremonies for Ashura are underway.”
response 1. “I aim to live like Muhammad, fight like Ali, and die like Hussein, with the teachings of the twelve imams in my thoughts.”
>continue the event chain
response 2. (Available to Alawiyya only) “I will engage in tatbir to remember the struggle of the third Imam.”
>continue event chain, chance of wounded
response 3 (only if indisposed because of war or other restrictions) “Though I grieve in this time, i cannot participate in any ceremony this year.”
>end event chain
For this, gfx of a crowd will do



Okay. Revivalist localizations for first two events
“A member of your court interrupts your council session with grave news. “There’s a shipwreck off the coast. They seem to be of foreign origin, my liege. Only one man has survived.”
and only one response - “Where could this man be from?”
use something like council gfx or whatever for that
Event two for not wahhabism
“The man is from a land to the east, which he calls “Maghreb” - your scholars identify this as one of the old world bastions of Islam. He is delighted to be in your court and in the presence of Muslims - and he offers himself at your service to further your knowledge of the faith.”
response 1: “I am interested in your lessons, Abdulaziz”
response 2: (if cynical/proud) “Bah, what would a simple camel merchant know about religion?”
response 2 ends event chain early
