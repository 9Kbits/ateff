Inuit Religion

Similar to West African in vanilla:

"The Inuit cosmos is ruled by no one. 
There are no divine mother and father figures. 
There are no wind gods and solar creators. 
There are no eternal punishments in the hereafter, as there are no punishments for children or adults in the here and now."
- Rachel Attituq Qitsualik, Inuk writer

"We don't believe. We fear."
- Aua (c. 1870 - post-1922) Inuk angakkuq 

Mechanics:

Uses Iqta government type? Temples can be held without penalty by any character (so long as they have the angakkuq trait?)
Unreformed pagan - there exists no religious head, and none can be created - can be revisited after holy fury, but papal governance - a council of angakkuq - might be an interesting direction to take
Defensive Pagan? 


Features:

Angakkuq - spiritual healers; more effective court physicians, have a chance to remove negative psychological traits (such as lunatic, possessed, stressed, depressed)
 - Can also help improve fertility, improve odds of finding the white stag?
 - Only characters with this trait can be made court chaplain?
 - Various ways of gaining the trait; random event, on birth, decision (can result in death or taboo trait if failed!), or apprenticeship?
 
- Can hold seances, similar to vision quests? "Ask to hold seance" as a diplomatic interaction?

Amulets and tattoos - unique modifiers (artifacts?) that can increase health. Tattoos similar to patron deities? 

Broke Taboo - trait that can be acquired by event, certain decisions, having certain traits?
	- Similar to excommunication, but there is no religious head to remove.) (How to remove?)
	- Causes unique failure event for hunting focus; animals believed to flee hunters that violated taboo
	- Severe negative relations penalty; characters are blamed for bad weather, accidents, etc.

Annual Ceremony to Appease Sedna (Name?)
	- Annual vision quest - angakkuq travels to the underworld where Sedna lives and helps her smooth out her hair
	- Can beg (more successful with high diplomacy) or fight (more successful with high martial or intrigue) Sedna to ensure that people do not starve
		- Success removes all excommunication from characters in realm; failure gives debuff to tax income, prosperity of capital for year?		
		
Unique hunting focus events
	- "Experiences such as hearing voices from ice or stones were discussed as readily as everyday hunting adventures"
	- Hunting focus gives events with temporary bonuses or penalties to stewardship

Inuit-culture rulers can build Inukshuk for prestige and an opinion bonus (similar to runestones)
	- Modifier also gives bonus to movement speed (in Inuit-culture/winter climate counties only?), hidden bonus on hunting focus events
	
Reincarnation?
