Many have come before him, preaching similar doctrines but attracting few followers, for the ruins of Old America are littered with books and signs advertising marvelous products that will cure all ills and bring true happiness. But this prophet's oratory has given him tens of thousands of followers, who are now spreading their faith across America by his words and by the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The prevailing interpretation of the Prophet's Catalog is that followers should strive to amass wealth so that they can buy more goods and placate the Invisible Hand, but a new sect called the Monetarists has emerged which challenges this. They argue that the accumulation of wealth is an end in itself, and that spending it profanes the Almighty Dollar. Though mainstream Consumerists have rejected this doctrine as heresy, many rulers and priests have professed their allegiance to the Monetarist doctrine, and the schism threatens to divide the whole Consumerist world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now, as the Norse religion becomes more organized, sacred warrior bands like the Heirs of Lief, the War-Boys, the Thunder Brothers and the Sons of Norway have taken to coming to the side of any Norseman in need of aid, while refusing to fight their brothers in faith. People have taken to collectively calling these zealots the Fylkir's Hundreds. Hardly a unified organization, they are a group of holy militia and temple guardians who will fight for any chief, Jarl or King willing to witness their ascension to Valhalla. Though they are for the most part leaderless and decentralized, a prominent soldier who calls himself their "Thane" has proven to be reliable in assembling them.

Here to establish a foothold, they call their new organization the Ordo Templi Occidentis, the western arm of their order. Though similar in many aspects to the legendary brotherhood of the Masons, they claim secret universal knowledge and powerful, ancient magic.

Of their diabolical goals only two are known: to defend the practitioners of the occult, and to ensure reasonable compensation for stoneworking throughout the eastern seaboard.

EVTDESC_eva.2;Rumors of trouble and rebellion are brewing in the Holy Columbian Confederacy. A young monk has recently published a historical and religious text on a newly-rediscovered ancient empire known as the "Holy Roman Empire." Destroyed in the early days of ancient America, this monk has written about a defining piece of their law, the 'Peace of Westphalia'. Made to end wars between Catholics and Evangelicals in the Old World, this treaty put forth a law that stated 'whose realm, his religion'. The monk has compared this law to the ancient Constitution and its declaration of freedom of religion, and declared that this right should be given to the vassals of the Confederacy. With the ideas of this treatise being spread throughout the Confederacy via itinerant preachers, the ideas create serious questions about the moral authority of the Evangelical faith, and the Emperor is sure to act swiftly...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_eva.3;The Westphalia Treatise;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.3;Rumors of trouble and rebellion have reached your court. A young monk has published a text on an ancient treaty, known as 'The Peace of Westphalia'. Demanding freedom of religion, the text challenges the authority of the Emperor and the Council President of the Evangelical faith. The Council President has asked for your help in combating this heresy. Already the monk's ideas have begun to spread throughout the Confederacy, and without swift action, many doctrines considered unorthodox may take hold...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.3;A fool's ramblings? Let him speak his sound and fury;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_eva.4;The monk is arrested and brought to your palace. Marched onto a platform, surrounded by onlookers, he is asked to recant his heresy. Gulping, the monk shakes his head defiantly. After being placed onto a block, his head is cut from his body. Your attention snaps to an angry noble, who shouts that the monk was under his protection. At the same time, a small group of peasants you recognize as Charismatic believers have rushed forward, attempting to dip handkerchiefs in the monks blood. No doubt they see him as a martyr. As the crowd becomes agitated, you see clearly that a show of force is required to reassert the authority of the Evangelical faith and your divine right as Emperor...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.4;Have the noble punished. They must learn who has God's favor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_eva.4;Martyrs? They shall have their martyrs. Execute the heretics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_eva.8;The noble is arrested and flogged for protecting a heretic, leaving the man battered and bruised. Whilst some are shocked by your treatment of a nobleman, your message gets across. Many nobles had supported the monk, considering his ideas an opportunity to expand their power, but that support has evaporated in the face of your threat of punishment. The nobles have now returned to their lands, and have increased their efforts to root out any remaining heresy amongst the peasantry. The Evangelical faith has retained its authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_eva.9;A Noble Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.9;The noble is arrested and flogged for protecting a heretic, leaving the man battered and bruised. However, what was intended as a warning has backfired. Outraged at the man's treatment and the monks execution, the nobility have begun to conspire amongst themselves. Many already supported the monk, and now as a martyr his words grant them a pretext to challenge your place as Emperor. The authority of the Evangelical faith is strongly in doubt, and the weak proclamations from Atlanta have little effect in swaying the rebellion...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.9;Perhaps my strength is not what I thought it was...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_eva.10;Subservient Peasants;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.10;You have the peasant group arrested and burned at the stake on the orders of the Council President. The move is shocking, going against the normally tolerant treatment of mild heresy in the Evangelical faith, but the message is clear. Any remaining heretics have fled underground, and any talk of martyrs or rebellion has disappeared. The Evangelical faith remains strong, and has set forth a stronger focus on orthodoxy in the wake of these events...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.10;In essentials, unity. Unity is strength, after all;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_eva.11;A Martyr's Birth;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.11;You have the peasant group arrested and burned at the stake on the orders of the Council President. The move is shocking, going against the focus on liberty of belief that characterizes the Evangelical faith. As news of these actions spread across the confederacy, more and more heretic preachers rise up and stir the peasantry into a frenzy. Calling on the 'Westphalian Martyrs' to guide them, rebellions have broken out across the confederacy. The Evangelical faith is in dire straits, with more and more abandoning it for heretical doctrines every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.11;Perhaps I should have focused on charity instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_eva.12;Might of the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.12;On the heels of the newly published Westphalia Treatise, news of the Emperor's reaction has reached your court. Furious at the monk, [From.GetTitledFirstName] ordered him executed. While a few see the monk as a martyr, the Emperor's might has managed to cow them into silence. The ideas laid out in the treatise have been forgotten, and life in the Confederacy has returned to normal. The Evangelical faith remains unchallenged within the Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.12;Truly, royalty rules through Divine Right;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_eva.12;The authorities truly are elected under God's will;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_eva.12;The blood of the martyrs shall one day be avenged...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_eva.13;A Martyr Born;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.13;On the heels of the news of the newly published Westphalia Treatise, news of the Emperor's reaction has reached your court. Furious at the monk, [From.GetTitledFirstName] ordered him executed. Rather than re-asserting his authority, however, the monk's death has inflamed the situation. Heretic creeds regard the monk as a martyr, and have begun pressing for civil war throughout the Confederacy. The Evangelical faith is left crippled, unable to end the rapidly growing heresies throughout the Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.13;Heaven help them, and Heaven preserve us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_eva.14;The Council of Augusta;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.14;With the original seats of the Ecumenical Council long since broken apart, you have gathered the leading clergy and nobility within the Confederacy to Augusta, a holy site of the Evangelical faith. Compared to splendor of the ancient Cathedral of Hepzibah, the monk's simple sackcloth robes appear inconsequential. However, you remain cautious. The monk has many supporters amongst the nobility, and his theology has already swayed many priests within the Confederacy. Of course, debating his arguments aren't the only method you could use to end this crisis...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.14;For the good of the realm, I shall convince him of his error;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_eva.14;He is a novice. I shall teach him of the error of his ways;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_eva.15;A Diplomatic Resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.15;Your skills in diplomacy are put on full display as the days of the Council unfold. Whilst you acknowledge some merit in his ideas, you explain to the monk that following the chaos of the Event, order must come before individual liberty. Whilst reluctant, the monk acknowledges your position and publicly declares his support for your leadership and the Evangelical church. You have managed to restore order in your realm, and your reputation as a great diplomat spreads throughout the land...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_eva.15;Unity, liberty. In all things, charity;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_eva.16;A Theological Resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_eva.16;Your theological training comes into play as the days of the Council unfold. Examining the monk's treatise, you deftly question its theological and political groundings, as the monk becomes increasingly unsure of his position. Finally, he kneels, quietly recanting his position.

EVTDESC_eva.17;Your skills in intrigue are used to great effect as the days of the Council unfold. As the monk argues his case before your scholars, you negotiate hidden plans with his supporters, convincing them to turn against him. This continues until the entire Council has turned against him, leaving the monk powerless. He finally bows to the opinion of the court, his ideas discredited, as he returns to his monastery.

Whilst the clergy of the Evangelical faith manage to maintain face, many of the onlooking nobility become increasingly swayed by the monks beliefs. The monk disappears at the end of the council. While his ideas are now publicly banned in the wake of the council, the heresy has simply gone underground with more and more nobles swayed by his ideas. Only time, or the re-establishment of the Evangelical Convention, could end the disorder that faces the Confederacy now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMECONSUMER5;Death of the Prophet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PROPHET_DIES_FAITHFUL_A;The Holy Prophet, the most exalted earthly messenger of the Almighty Dollar, has completed his work on this earth and returned to his master. Just before dying, the Prophet appointed [d_consumerist.Holder.GetBestName] to be his successor on Earth and left his final revelation - his death would mark not the end, but the true beginning of the Consumerist faith. [d_consumerist.Holder.GetBestName]'s first act was to declare the day of the Prophet's death to be a day of mourning for all Consumerists until the end of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PROPHET_DIES_FAITHFUL_B;The Holy Prophet of Consumerism is now dead. Although your community has been unsure what to make of this new religious movement, it is hard to deny that this day is a sad one. A successor to the Prophet has already been appointed, but many are unsure whether Consumerism will be able to survive the death of its charismatic founder. However, Consumerism has made remarkable gains in a short period of time, and it is hard for you to believe that all of it can be reversed by the death of one man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PROPHET_DIES_INFIDEL;The so-called "Holy Prophet" of the Consumerist hordes has finally been struck down for his hubris.

[d_monetarist.Holder.GetSheHeCap] alleges that the Prophet appointed [d_monetarist.Holder.GetHerHim] as his true successor and told his final revelation to [d_monetarist.Holder.GetHerHim]. According to [d_monetarist.Holder.GetBestName], the Prophet declared that the best way to strengthen the Almighty Dollar is save one's Capital and Shop responsibly - the Prophet's great promotion of Shopping was justifiable due to his unheard-of store of Capital and necessary for the Dollar's word to be spread across the land. Although this completely contradicts established Consumerist doctrine, [d_monetarist.Holder.GetBestName] insists that [d_monetarist.Holder.GetHerHis] words are true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_halloween_4;Happy Halloween!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_halloween_5;You have spent hours trying to scare others, and you have done better than you could have ever imagined. Your performances were so convincing that more than one person fainted from shock, and you were practically showered with gold. You begin to walk home, pride welling in your chest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_halloween_5;I can't wait for next year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_halloween_7;As you walk home, you come across a shivering and starving child. He flags you down, explaining that his parents both died exactly one year ago and that he has been left to wander the streets ever since. He notices the food in your knapsack, and his mouth begins to water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_halloween_7;You can have as much as you like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_halloween_make_it_home;You make it home without incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_halloween_7;I worked for my food. Maybe you should try that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_halloween_8;As you walk home, you suddenly come face-to-face with a hideous beast. You cry out in terror... only for the beast to cry back! After a pause, the "beast" removes his mask, revealing an ordinary man underneath. He laughs and remarks that he must try this costume again next year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_halloween_8;Yes, it was very convincing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_halloween_9;As you walk home, you suddenly hear an earsplitting shriek rend the air. You cry out in shock... only to see a young man quivering in fear.

EVTOPTA_halloween_9;Was my costume really that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_halloween_10;As you walk home, you get lost in a strange forest. As you try to retrace your steps, you suddenly spot a clearing. In the middle are three witches surrounding a bubbling cauldron. The one closest to you makes eye contact and begins speaking. "Ah, perfect. We were looking for someone to try our newest brew.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_halloween_10;What's the worst that could happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_drink_potion_consent;You step forward towards the cauldron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_halloween_11;Get out of my way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_witch_escape;You successfully free yourself from the witches' clutches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_witch_captured;You are unable to break free from the witches' grasp.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_halloween_12;After you step towards the cauldron, the same witch who spoke to you earlier lifts a ladle from it and brings it to your lips. You swallow the mixture, and you suddenly feel warmth and strength spreading across your body. The witch seems pleased. "Our mixture works, sisters! Let us rejoice!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_halloween_12;You are dragged back to the cauldron. The witch who taunted you earlier grabs your head and shoves it directly inside the cauldron. Eventually, your head is brought back up, and the two other witches release you. You stand up, somehow feeling much better than you did before you were dunked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_halloween_12;I feel... revitalized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_halloween_good_potion;The potion has a positive effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_halloween_20;You make it home to your palace safely, and lie in your bed... only to be awoken by distant shrieking.
