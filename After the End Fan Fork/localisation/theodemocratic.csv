mormon_government;Theodemocratic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mormon_government_desc;The theodemocratic form of government is very similar to the feudal system that is upheld across the US and the bureaucracy upheld by California. Emphasizing the importance of democratic value and how it is innately intwined with the faith, Mormon and Latter Day Saints rulers may hold temples as well as castles. Rulers may also freely revoke Judge titles and retract vassals, but otherwise must follow Feudal law. If you switch from a Latter-day Saints faith, your government type will switch to feudal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

playerbrit_DESC;A long time ago, the one true nation underneath her majesty, the Queen, had a sprawling empire that spanned across every plane of reality. Yet, tragedy and treachery have brought forth the death of this mighty empire.

playerbrit.3.name;The Arrival of Her Majesty's Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
playerbrit.3.desc;Years ago, a colonial party was sent out from the British heartland to survey the lands of the New World. And yet, what they found there was a land of great empires and kingdoms, of technology and culture, and perhaps most importantly- of wealth. After being "personally" notified of the worth of this land by the highest priests of the Thelemic creed, her Majesty has declared an invasion of the New World, sending tens of thousands of men to fortify her outpost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TITLE_cetic_gaian;The Incorporation of the Gaian Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_cetic_gaian;For hundreds of years, the Gaian and Cetic faiths have shared a close yet troubled relationship. While mostly mutually compatible, strife and struggle has remained, as imperial protectorates clashed with Cascadian swords. Long ago, attempts were made to bring these two faiths into harmony- but with the outbreak of the Green Sash Rebellion under Emperor Chad the Boneless, relations between the faith took a sharp turn for worse, and no attempts have been made since. However, in recent years, the Celestial Empire has come to rule over their northern neighbors once more, and in a reversal of prior policy, the court has issued an imperial decree ordering the reintegration of the old "Way of the Branch" in an attempt to bring Gaian rulers into the Cetic school of thought. Backed by the Emperor's power, this theological diplomacy is sure to bring many to recognize how their native Gaian faith can fit within the Cetic philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
