mormon_government;Theodemocratic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mormon_government_desc;The theodemocratic form of government is very similar to the feudal system that is upheld across the US and the bureaucracy upheld by California. Emphasizing the importance of democratic value and how it is innately intwined with the faith, Mormon and Latter Day Saints rulers may hold temples as well as castles. Rulers may also freely revoke Judge titles and retract vassals, but otherwise must follow Feudal law. If you switch from a Latter-day Saints faith, your government type will switch to feudal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

playerbrit_TITLE;The Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
playerbrit_DESC;A long time ago, the one true nation underneath her majesty, the Queen, had a sprawling empire that spanned across every plane of reality. Yet, tragedy and treachery have brought forth the death of this mighty empire. However, in servitude to her holy name, a colonial expedition has been sent across the great Atlantic to survey the barbarism that has surely sprung up in her absence. If the land is worthy of her name, perhaps more troops will follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

playerbrit.3.name;The Arrival of Her Majesty's Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
playerbrit.3.desc;Years ago, a colonial party was sent out from the British heartland to survey the lands of the New World. And yet, what they found there was a land of great empires and kingdoms, of technology and culture, and perhaps most importantly- of wealth. After being "personally" notified of the worth of this land by the highest priests of the Thelemic creed, her Majesty has declared an invasion of the New World, sending tens of thousands of men to fortify her outpost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
