EVTDESC_ceno002;To become a mountain father or mother one must fully devote themselves to the service of God and the divine things. One must seek freedom from the temptation of the flesh and reject all sin. One must fast and pray and strive towards righteousness in the eyes of God. While the path is arduous, the gifts of the knowledge of the omnipotent God and the eternal salvation is the most comforting of rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_ceno002;Take care to be silent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ceno003;"The body prospers in the measure in which the soul is weakened, and the soul prospers in the measure in which the body is weakened. Since the Sundering monastic communities have formed in the Great Rocky Mountains. Many devout christians have chosen to serve the Church as either deacons or canons but only the most pious choose the life of a Mountain Father. Poverty and asceticism in service of the Lord. As you don on the religious habit you follow in the footsteps of the hundreds of brothers and sisters of the cloth who have preceded you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_ceno003;Trusted with God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
