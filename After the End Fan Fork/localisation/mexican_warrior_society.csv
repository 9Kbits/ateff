EVTDESCHF10523_A;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\nAs members of [Root.Society.GetName] we strive to better ourselves and each other! One way is the occasional sparring match, for practice and honor.\nSeek out and wrestle the [duel_target.GetSocietyRank] [duel_target.GetFirstName] – you will find [duel_target.GetHerHim] in [duel_target.Location.GetName].\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCHF10523_B;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]! \n\n[Root.Society.GetNameCap] have been watching you, and I believe it is time for us to meet in the sparring ring. A [duel_target.GetSocietyRank] cannot afford to get rusty! What say you? Will you seek me out for an honorable match?\nI will be waiting for you in [duel_target.Location.GetName].\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16003_default;[combatant_1.GetBestName] has challenged you to a [combatant_1.GetDuelType]. The only respectable response would be to accept the challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16003_mock_duel;My [hero_character.GetSisterBrother] in [Root.Society.GetName], [hero_character.GetTitledName], informs me that [combatant_1.GetBestName] needs someone to partake in a [combatant_1.GetDuelType], in an attempt for the eager recruit to prove [combatant_1.GetHerselfHimself] to us. The only respectable response would be to agree to help out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16004;[From.GetBestName] has chosen to accept your challenge to a wrestling match. The match will take place in the next few days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16004_mock_duel;[hero_character.GetBestName] and [From.Society.GetName] have chosen [From.GetTitledName] as my opponent. The [From.GetAgeAdjective] [From.GetManWoman] eyes me up and down when we are introduced. "Fresh meat, eh?" [From.GetSheHe] offers mockingly, before shoving an elbow into my side, making everyone laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16004_mock_duel_spouse;[hero_character.GetBestName] and [From.Society.GetName] have chosen [From.GetTitledName] as my opponent. "Is this a joke"? I ask, my [From.GetRootRelation] smiling innocently. "It is but a formality, my dear" [From.GetSheHe] shrugs. I let out a nervous laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16004_bloodline;[From.GetTitledName] has volunteered as my opponent. I am uncertain what [From.GetSheHe] thinks of my lineage, and judging from the whispers surrounding us as we shake hands, so is [From.GetSheHe]... "Best of luck to you both!" [hero_character.GetBestName] says, shooting [From.GetFirstName] a reassuring glance. I let go of [From.GetManWoman]'s grip, noticing the sweat of [From.GetHerHis] hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16004;A [GetDuelType], huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_HFP_10096;That's what I thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16004_TT;The match will take place within the next few days.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16006;"Not so fast", a voice whispers in my ear, as I'm preparing to turn in for the night. I turn around, but something stings my throat. A dagger? "We WILL wrestle, dear [Root.GetFirstName], do you understand? Nod if you understand." Panic pounding in my chest, I nod, carefully as to not hurt myself further. "Good", the [From.GetManWoman] says, and pulls away into the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_HFP_16006_TT;You gulp, as it seems you have no choice. You will wrestle [From.GetTitledName]!, in a few days time.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16007;While attempting to talk some sense into [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName], in regards to [combatant_2.GetHerHim] declining my challenge, I have decided to sneak into [combatant_2.GetHerHis] [combatant_2.GetCapitalHolding]. Fidgeting with the dagger in my sleeve, I have a good feeling about this, when suddenly I hear people shouting. "Who goes there?" they demand, and I am surrounded by guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16009_default;As the match goes on, [combatant_2.GetTitledFirstName] and I get more and more desparate with grapples and finishing moves. I finally grab him and attempt to land a final blow, but [combatant_2.GetSheHe] overpowers me and flings us out of the ring, with both of our heads landing... akwardly on the floor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving sluggishly. Perhaps it's due to the special breakfast I had my agents prepare for [other_combatant.GetHerHim], but it is clear that the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is not in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] best form. Before anyone catches on, I attack with full force. It feels almost too easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_A;My body is cramping, as [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] braces for another attack. The following moments are a blur, blood suddenly everywhere, somebody shouting. "Did [Root.GetTitledFirstName] just [Root.GetKillingBlow]?!"
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_B;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] throws out [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly]. The fight has gone on forever, and my muscles are beginning to ache. With the remainder of my strength I [Root.GetKillingBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_C;My opponent seems to be getting tired, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] moves becoming slower. Strengthened by the cheers of the crowd, I [Root.GetKillingBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_A_W;It seems like ages have passed in the ring as both [other_combatant.GetBestName] and I begin to use more and more dangerous moves. Thinking quickly, I perch myself upon the ropes and leap forward towards [other_combatant.GetHerHim], elbow at the front. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] doesn't last long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_B_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] and I are starting to grab without any plan, wildly flailing with each other in our grasp. I finally get out of [other_combatant.GetHerHis] grip and quickly punch [other_combatant.GetHerHim] in the throat. I watch in awe as they collapse instantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_C_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] is quickly becoming and equal in my mind as my unrelenting fury of blows seemingly do not land. However, I spot and hole in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] defense, and I land a series of hard blows against [other_combatant.GetHerHis] body. I step back when I realize that blood is seeping out of [other_combatant.GetFirstName]'s body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16011_D_W;I am running out of options as [other_combatant.GetBestName] does not fall prey to my style. I decide to go all in and attempt to incapacitate [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. I extend my foot, trip my foe, and give [other_combatant.GetHerHim] a series of blows. It is not long until I realize [other_combatant.GetHerHim] stopped breathing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_A_attacker;My [other_combatant.GetRootRelation] seems unaware that the little wound I inflicted is what is causing [other_combatant.GetHerHis] limbs to slowly go numb... "Valiant effort!" I proclaim, watching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] sluggish movements. When [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lunges at me, I carefully step aside, letting [other_combatant.GetHerHis] subsequent collapse look like a failed attack. The poison must have reached [other_combatant.GetHerHis] heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16011_intrigue_A_defender_spymaster;"Impressive!" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] splutters, on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] knees in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc]. Finally, I let the anger fill me. "I had your 'solution' switched", I hiss, as I take my fist to [other_combatant.GetHerHis] throat. "I have eyes and ears everywhere", I explain to the bewildered [other_combatant.GetManWoman]. "You thought I'd let you *poison* me?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
you_win_the_match_tt;You win the match.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16012_A;Just as I begin to think that I am wearing my opponent down, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] lunges at me, with more force than so far displayed. Sweat drips down my forehead, when suddenly, I hear someone shouting, describing the scene incredulously. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] has managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe].
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_B;The fight has been going on for some time and it's with some effort I'm still throwing out moves, [Root.GetClumsilyElegantly]. [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] looks tired too, but suddenly [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [Root.GetKillingBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_C;Each movement of my body is becoming heavier, and I'm struggling to focus on my opponent, as the crowd cheers [other_combatant.GetHerHim] on. My vision is blurry when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [other_combatant.GetKillingBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16012_intrigue_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is moving [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly], yet I can barely even muster the strength to hold myself upright. "You look tired, my [Root.GetLordLady]", [other_combatant.GetSheHe] says, stepping closer. I want to protest, but my head is swimming. Smirking, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] swings [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fist, and [Root.GetKillingBlowOnMeShort].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_A_W;Ages have seemingly passed as [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] and I begin to use more dangerous moves. Suddenly, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] perches [other_combatant.GetHerHim]self upon the ropes of the ring, and jumps towards me. The the last thing I hear are my ribs breaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_B_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] and I are starting to throw out any move that comes to the top of our heads. [other_combatant.GetBestName] rips [other_combatant.GetHerselfHimself] out of my grasp, and punches me in the throat. I collapse attempting to take in air with no luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16012_C_W;In both speed and strength I am matching my foe [other_combatant.GetBestName]. However, I left a hole in my defense, and [other_combatant.GetBestName] quickly takes advantage in this, and lands multiple devastating blows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
you_lose_the_match_tt;You lose the match.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16013_mock_duel_A;The match has gone on for what feels like hours – the initial confidence I felt has begun to wane, and my movements are getting sloppy. Then, just as my knees are about to give way under me, I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_mock_duel_B;As the match begins, [other_combatant.GetTitledName] comes at me slowly. I offer [other_combatant.GetHerHim] my best taunting smile, and it does not take long before I have seen to [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_mock_duel_C;The onlookers are cheering for me, as I swing my fists with increasing enthusiasm. When it's over, [other_combatant.GetTitledName] is on the ground, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face red with embarrassment. I shrug, smiling to the crowd, and at my opponent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_intrigue_default;For a moment I am worried that [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is going to fall, but [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] does not appear to notice my sabotage. All I need to do is land a blow in the right area and... There! The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is spinning, clutching [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], screaming in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_A;"It's a good day for wrestling!", I chuckle, stretching out all the necessary muscles. "Enough talking", my opponent growls. Soon, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is lying face down in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc], as I have seen to [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_B;My opponent looks nervous, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] mask a little ill-fitting, and I briefly contemplate asking if [other_combatant.GetSheHe] would rather do this another day... A moment later, I snap out of it, letting the fresh morning air sharpen my senses instead. The [other_combatant.GetCharacterLook] [other_combatant.GetManWoman] is soon on the ground, groaning in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_C;The sun is beginning to set when I meet with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], my body ready. After [other_combatant.GetSheHe] [other_combatant.GetClumsilyElegantly] dodges one attack, my next one lands perfectly. Frantically, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] attempts to cover [other_combatant.GetHerHis] injured [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], but I have rarely seen such a purple bruise...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_A_W;As the match goes on, I begin to recall the training in the Eagle tactics. I rip myself from [other_combatant.GetBestName]'s grasp and perch upon the ropes. Although the impact of the descent did incapacitate [other_combatant.GetBestName], it also injured me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_B_W;The match between [other_combatant.GetBestName] and I quickly turned into a grappling match, with the tide rarely turning in the midst of it. After temporarily losing my footing and receiving a blow for it, I found an opening in my opponent's defense, and ended the match soon after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_C_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName], being exceptionally defensive in the match, did not leave much room for my style to take its effects. After each of us landed multiple blows, I finally got the upper hand when I exploited one of [other_combatant.GetBestName]'s wide attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_default_E;I am swinging my arms wildly, when suddenly, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] shrieks in pain. Stopping my crazed flailing, I am stuck staring at the mess I have made. It seems I have managed to [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16014_mock_duel_A;A simple [combatant_1.GetDuelType] or not, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has an air of unquestioned confidence about [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. When I charge, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] snickers. At the end of it all, I am lying on the ground, after my opponent made sure to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_mock_duel_B;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] charges at me, and has soon managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]. The crowd does not seem impressed by my effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_mock_duel_C;The onlookers are cheering for [other_combatant.GetTitledName], as [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fists with increasing enthusiasm. When it's over, the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] looks at me with pity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_intrigue_default;I instructed the squire to weaken one of my opponent's body parts, but I am having trouble spotting the sabotage. "Are you making a wish?" [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] asks, impatiently – we have been at this for hours, and my scheming has lead nowhere. I back away, clutching my [GetBodyPartInjured]. [GetSeverityOfInjuryCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_A;"Don't look so glum", [other_combatant.GetTitledName] offers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] has me on the ground, *again*, and I am losing any patience I ever had. "You oaf-" I begin, but I collapse from the pain. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] has managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe], and the clear scent of blood has me dizzy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_B;I am not sure what is wrong with me, but nothing I do has any effect on [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. "Come on, don't give up already!" [other_combatant.GetSheHe] commands, disgruntlement clear in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] voice. I try to rise, but I can't. My [Root.GetBodyPartInjured] hurts like it never has before. "I am just going to rest a little, here in the [Root.Capital.GetGroundDesc]", I mumble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_C;Pain is throbbing in my [GetBodyPartInjured], and I clench my jaw, trying not to cry. "It's not over!" I growl, but my opponent is lowering [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fists. The last rays of the evening sun envelops [other_combatant.GetHerHim], and suddenly, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] looks like a warrior sent by the heavens themselves...! In an attempt to say something about it, I pass out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_default_E;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] is swinging [other_combatant.GetHerHis] fists wildly, when suddenly, a shriek of pain cuts through the air. Staggering, I realize that the voice is my own – my opponent has managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_A_W;[other_combatant.GetBestName] and I were duking it out pretty evenly over the course of our match until [other_combatant.GetSheHe] ripped [other_combatant.GetHerselfHimself] out of my grasp. All of a sudden, [other_combatant.GetFirstName] did an Aguila move, and it was over. Although I was defeated, I saw [other_combatant.GetFirstName] stumble away from me, grasping [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [GetBodyPartInjured].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16014_B_W;The match between [other_combatant.GetBestName] and I soon devolved into a grappling mess, with the chances of victory ebbing and flowing. After I caught [other_combatant.GetFirstName] off-guard, I had my blow returned to be tenfold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16013_C_W;My defensive strategy seemed to be working against [other_combatant.GetBestName]'s aggresive style, until I left myself wide open. Even though in my struggle I landed some blows, I was soon pinned and defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16015;I was holding my fists in front of me, locking eyes with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The crowd began to whisper, as my opponent fidgeted awkwardly, [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face growing paler. I thought [other_combatant.GetSheHe] was about to faint, when the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] started running, away from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16016;Still shivering, I cannot explain what happened. When it all came down to it, my legs gave way and I simply... I fled the match! I am such a coward..! Why did I ever agree to this in the first place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16017;Just as I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow], [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] manages to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]. However, the crowd is chanting MY name!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_B;My [GetBodyPartInjured] hurts, but it somehow doesn't seem as bad as what my opponent is suffering. "I'm not done!", [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] says, through gritted teeth, but then [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lies back down on the ground, rolling around wildly. When I step closer [other_combatant.GetSheHe] splutters: "No no, I'm done! I yield!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_C;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] is taken aback when I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow]. "[Root.GetTitledFirstName] wins!" someone proclaims, and my opponent groans. I am ignoring the pain in my [GetBodyPartInjured], but I have a suspicion [GetSeverityOfInjury].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_A_W;As I drop from the skies on to my opponent, I realize that I landed a bit wrong. Although I did injure my [GetBodyPartInjured], the referee proclaims me the victor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_B_W;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]'s hits have been damaging to me, but I bear it and land a devastating blow. Which knocks [other_combatant.GetHerHim] down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16017_C_W;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] and I seem to equally trade blows throughout the match, however, I find a weakness and make good work of it. Although I am in pain, [other_combatant.GetBestName] is on the ground, groaning in pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16018;Just as I [other_combatant.GetWeaponInjuringBlow], [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] manages to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]. Dizzy, I can just about make out the sounds of the crowd: it is not my name they are chanting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_B;"No, I can still fight!" I say, dropping to my knees, sensing my own lie. Even though [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] has clearly injured [other_combatant.GetHerHis] [other_combatant.GetBodyPartInjured], [other_combatant.GetSheHe] has been proclaimed the winner. Sighing, I ponder my own worst injury. I have a feeling [Root.GetSeverityOfInjury].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_C;"You don't give up, do you?" my opponent laughs. "I've thought about it", I mutter, attempting to stand. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] did just [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe]... As I slump back on the ground, [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] smiles in triumph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_A_W;When [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] climbed up on the ropes and began [other_combatant.GetHerHis] descent, I knew it was the end for me. Although [other_combatant.GetSheHe] did win, they did hurt themselves in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_B_W;Even though I was wailing on [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], [other_combatant.GetSheHe] did not seem ready to quit. When I left myself too wide after an attempted shot, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] gave me a devastating blow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16018_C_W;[other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] and I were trading blows pretty equally, until [other_combatant.GetSheHe] spots and weakness in my office and grapples me, not letting go until [other_combatant.GetSheHe] makes the match-ending move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16019_default;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe], when [other_combatant.GetSheHe] lets out an angry grunt. Before I know it, I am begging for mercy, but [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is beyond reasoning. The last thing I hear is the shocked gasp of the crowd, and a soft thud, which can only be my head hitting the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16019_intrigue;[other_combatant.GetTitledName] has already managed to [Root.GetWrestlingInjuringBlowOnMe], when something twisted passes over [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I barely register the glint of something metal in [other_combatant.GetHerHis] hand, before my throat is cut open, blood spraying on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] face. I try to ask why, but no words come out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16021_mock_duel;I know that there wasn't really anything at stake during the mock match that took place between us, yet I find myself filling with rage whenever anyone mentions [other_combatant.GetTitledName], and it's making servants flinch. But does it matter? I am the [Root.GetTitle]! Am I not allowed to loathe that [other_combatant.GetManWoman]?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16021_incapable;There are noises. Metal, clanging. A fight? Are those soldiers practicing, or is this another nightmare? The twisted face of [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName], as [other_combatant.GetSheHe] is laughing at me, after our duel? My heart racing, I still cannot move from my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16021_default;Sometimes, when I see my soldiers practicing their wrestling skills in the training grounds, the face of [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] flashes before my mind's eye, and I relive the match we fought. It sends my heart racing, how I failed to defend my honor. Some days, the shame is overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16022_incapable;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently slipped into a deep slumber, and does not show any signs of waking. However, I am told that the last thing anyone heard [From.GetHerHim] talking about was our match and how [From.GetSheHe] would find a way to take revenge on me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16023_mock_duel;Since the match, I have been practicing a bit with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName]. The [other_combatant.GetManWoman] did best me, and I was quick to ask for any pointers. [other_combatant.GetSheHeCap] seemed surprised at first, but today I am proud to tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] that [other_combatant.GetSheHe]'s a good teacher. "And friend!" I add.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16023_default;I have recently found myself talking with [other_combatant.GetTitledFirstName] for hours, about [other_combatant.GetRootMatchingPersonalityStreak]. I have to laugh, however, when the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] attempts to compliment my wrestling technique – we both know that I didn't do very well, last time we sparred.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16024_mock_duel;After the match, [From.GetTitledName] asked me for advice on fighting. A little taken aback, I happily offered to train with [From.GetHerHim], on occasion. Today, [From.GetSheHe] thanks me, for being a good teacher. "And friend," [From.GetSheHe] adds, dunking me on the back, before [From.GetSheHe] cocks [From.GetHerHis] head, in direction of the ring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16024_default;I have recently found myself becoming friendly with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] chuckles heartily, however, when I attempt to compliment the [From.GetManWoman] on [From.GetHerHis] wrestling technique. "My [Root.GetLordLady], we both know that I did not do very well, last time we sparred", [From.GetSheHe] says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_16025_new_crush_A;Ever since we wrestled, I have been having daydreams, about [other_combatant.GetFirstName]. I keep seeing [other_combatant.GetHerHim] in my mind's eye, and my heart flutters. I can't tell [other_combatant.GetHerHim] though... [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_new_crush_B;It's dark when I jolt awake, my heart pounding in my chest. Wiping the sweat from my brow, the memory of my dream lingers. I was wrestling [other_combatant.GetFirstName] again, but instead of delivering the winning blow, this time, [other_combatant.GetSheHe] put [other_combatant.GetHerHis] arm around my waist, and pulled me in for a kiss. When will these dreams end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_new_crush_C;I thought I saw [other_combatant.GetFirstName] today, in the ring. I was wrong, and the [other_combatant.GetManWoman] was startled to find [other_combatant.GetHerHis] liege putting a hand on [other_combatant.GetHerHis] shoulder. Embarrassed, I fled. Oh, why does my heart long for [other_combatant.GetFirstName]? [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_crushing_already;Ever since [other_combatant.GetFirstName] bested me in our match, I yearn to be near [other_combatant.GetHerHim], even more than before. I'm filled with thoughts and visions of us together, yet I dare not approach [other_combatant.GetHerHim]. [other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HFP_16025_crush_past;I've had trouble sleeping, ever since the duel with [other_combatant.GetFirstName], and it's affecting my temper. When my councilors begged me to clarify my thoughts on a matter, I simply blurted out that "[other_combatant.GetRootRomanticWorry]";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HF_16029_A;My [craven_ruler.GetRootRelation] confesses that [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] has recently turned down another match [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] was challenged to. I am not sure what words of comfort I can offer, but I understand [craven_ruler.GetHerHis] feelings of guilt and shame. Is this the ruler [craven_ruler.PrimaryTitle.GetName] should have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_HF_16029_B;[craven_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] recently turned down another match [craven_ruler.GetSheHe] was challenged to. At first I was embarrassed, on behalf of all [craven_ruler.GetHerHis] subjects, but who am I to say I would not react the same way? Perhaps there is value in choosing your battles...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HF_561_DESC;A fellow member of [Root.Society.GetName], §Y[lodge_member_killed.GetFirstNameWithNick]§!, has been killed in combat by §Y[lodge_member_killer.GetFirstNameWithNick]§!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_HFP_10196;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] suffered an untimely death before we could see to our match. I'll have to approach [warrior_lodge_to_join.GetName] anew.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR2;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nIt has come to our attention that you have not been training in the recent months. To be a successful luchador, you must be in prime fitness at all times. Go to one of our training stations to get yourself in shape!\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWR3;Arriving at my local training center, I am met with the sight of men and women, some of them my brothers and sister in Los Luchadores. All I hope is that I do not do anything stupid in front of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR3;I just have to focus on my regiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
you_will_train_TT;Over the next few days, you will train to reach the standards of [Root.Society.GetTitledGrandMasterName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWR5_A;Partway into my training regiment, as I am pressing a particularly heavy set of weights, my hand suddenly slips, causing my other arm to contort in a way it should not have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWR5_B;As I was lifting a heavy set of weights, one of my legs gives way. The next few second feel like hours as I witness my leg flop awkwardly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR5;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
no_improve_skills_TT;Your skills do not improve after this session.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR6;After a few days of graceless excercise and the burn of stares from more experienced people, I have finally completed my mandated training regiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR6;I... don't feel much stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
barely_improve_skills_TT;Your skills barely improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR7;Several days of workout later, and I feel as if I am finally getting somewhere with this excercise stuff!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR7;I feel great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
improve_skills_TT;Your skills improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR8;After finishing the last of my reps, I instantly feel a change. Working out is starting to become easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR8;I could go for a couple more rounds of this stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR9;Wrapping up the last of my workouts, it feels easier and easier to do this stuff after each excercise I go through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR9;Absolute lightwork!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
greatly_improve_skills_TT; Your skills greatly improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR11;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\nWe are pleased with your progress. During the time you spent training you have taken a great steps in improving yourself within the ring. Hereby I declare your mission completed.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR11;You honor me, [From.GetSocietyRank].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR12;To [Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName]\nI have heard some disturbing tales regarding your time at the gym, [Root.GetSocietyRank]. I fear that you are not yet ready for the training I expected of you. We will revisit this mission at a later date, but for the time being, I must consider this a failure.\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR12;I have failed you, [From.GetSocietyRank];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR13;After months of regularly working out, I am starting to feel... stronger...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR13;Huzzah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR100;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nAs a [Root.GetSocietyRank], it is your duty to partake in the tradition in making a persona. Go, and choose to be either a Rudo or a Tecnico!\n\nSigned, [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR101;Now that I am a [Root.GetSocietyRank], I must choose a luchador persona in accordance to the ancient rules of Lucha Libre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR101;I shall become a tecnico, defender of the good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_face_TT;Become a tecnico, the heroes of Lucha Libre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWR101;I shall become a rudo, defeater of the good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_heel_TT;Become a rudo, the villians of Lucha Libre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR103;Hail, [Root.GetSocietyRank]!\n\nWe are pleased that you have chosen to honor the traditions of Lucha Libre! Now you are *truly* a luchador!\n\nSigned, [From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR103;You honor me [From.GetSocietyRank];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR104;Now that I am properly acquainted with the way of Lucha Libre, I should choose a lucha style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR104;I shall be the noble eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_eagle_TT;Become an Aguila, the oldest of the styles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBWR104;I shall be the voracious jaguar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTCWR104;I shall be the crafty snake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_snake_TT;Become a Serpiente, which prioritizes dodges, grapples, and swift attacks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 

EVTDESCWR200;After being in the Luchadores for a while, I am feeling things that I never had before. Being so... close to people my sex just gets to be in a way it never did before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR200;I can't deny these feelings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR301;After adopting a tecnico persona, the attributes of a tecnico are beginning to seep into my personal life. I am now realizing that I am nicer than I was before, and I find that my vassals can notice the change as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR301;If it makes my vassals happy, I am all for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR302;After adopting a rudo persona, the traits normally attributed to them have begun to bleed into everyday life. I find myself flying into blind rages when a vassal disagrees with me and being all around ruder than I was before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR302;If my vassals don't like it they can GET OUT.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAWR401_TT;You'll approach the [new_recruit.GetManWoman] to explain the initiation match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAWR402_TT;You agree to wrestle whoever it is that §Y[hero_character.Society.GetNameCap]§! has chosen for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR403_yes;[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] offered no protests when I explained our traditions, eyes all aglitter at the thought of an initiation match. After some inquiry, [duel_target.GetTitledName] has kindly volunteered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCWR403_no;[new_recruit.GetTitledFirstName] listened while I explained our tradition of one-on-one matches, but then rolled [new_recruit.GetHerHis] eyes and walked off. "I would rather not get involved with barbarians.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAWR403_TT_1;A sparring match will take place between §Y[new_recruit.GetTitledName]§! and §Y[duel_target.GetTitledName]§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR405_they_fled;Just as [combatant_2.GetTitledName] was about to show [From.GetTitledName] what wrestling match should look like, the [From.GetAgeAdjective] [From.GetManWoman] ran away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR406_was_seriously_injured;To the brave [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI understand you were seriously injured during your initiation, but that you remained standing. To reward this display of strength in the match, I hereby officially invite you into our ranks.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR413;My [recruiting_parent.GetRootRelation] is making some less than subtle remarks over dinner tonight, commenting on my wrestling skills and asking how interested I am in luchadors. "Honestly, [Root.GetFirstName]... When are you going to become a member of [recruiting_parent.Society.GetName]?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCWR410_A;My [new_recruit.GetAgeAdjective] [new_recruit.GetSonDaughter] has joined me for dinner tonight, and not stopped talking about [new_recruit.GetHerHis] initiation match. "It was exhilarating, [Root.GetFatherMother]! And now I am one of [new_recruit.Society.GetName]!".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
