Her spirit brother, Jesus Christ, revealed to her many things, including a vision where she saw Elton Yudkow I punished by God for leading His people astray in California. Christ then revealed that she was a reincarnation of Captain Moroni, destined to enlighten the Californians and return them to a righteous way of living. He gave to her a demon-slaying sword, and then told her to travel to the ï¿½House of Mormonï¿½ in the east for further assistance.\nDuring her journey here, she was beset by bandits who robbed her of all she had, including the sword, but through the grace of God she escaped otherwise unscathed. She now stands before you, asking for your assistance in her divine mission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Their futile rage against the heavens shall soon be forgotten by history.\nThe treacherous Karen herself, rather than face the consequences of her crimes, has eluded imperial capture through death in a cowardly attempt to escape to the afterlife. Her followers laid her to rest in a simple burial, but imperial forces exhumed her corpse and beheaded it. Her body was then cremated, and the ashes were catapulted into the sea to ensure that she would forever be denied a resting place.\nWith such a steep penalty applied to the traitors, further Mormon revolt is unlikely to rear its head within California.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After countless weeks of tireless study, you believe you have found this solution. Ancient legends speak of a sprawling empire not unlike our own that dominated the old world. Most singular of this legendary empire's wonders was a magnificent and impenetrable wall that divided the lands, keeping the empire's enemies out in the cold.

EVTDESC_greatwall_finished_emperor;Over ninety years have passed since planning of the Long Sea Wall began under the rule of [first_greatwall_emperor.GetBestName], and few live now who remember the day construction began. Yet, history shall record forever the momentous occasion the final brick of the Wall was laid in the heart of [c_san_francisco.GetName], completing the greatest feat of engineering ever witnessed in this post-Event world. At its highest point measuring forty-five feet tall and protecting over eight hundred miles of Californian coast, the Long Sea Wall shall surely serve as California's mightiest shield for generations to come, and you, [Root.GetBestName], under whose reign it was completed, shall be remembered forevermore as California's protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_greatwall_finished;All of California celebrates as a project over ninety years in the making reaches fruition - from the hills of [c_humboldt.GetName] to the beaches of [c_santa_barbara.GetName] now stretches a mighty rampart: the Long Sea Wall of California, which serves to protect the Gran Franciscan coasts and the Valleyan heartland from raider and naval invader. At its highest point the wall measures forty-five feet tall and it protects over eight hundred miles of Californian coast, causing many to consider it the largest man-made structure ever built. Though construction of the wall began over ninety years ago under the reign of [first_greatwall_emperor.GetBestName], it will surely be [last_greatwall_emperor.GetBestName] who is immortalized for guiding its construction to the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_greatwall_finished;Let my legacy be as immortal as this wall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_greatwall_finished;An impressive feat, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_warbike;The velocipede has long been a uniquely Californian machine, and a machine of high stature reserved for lords and their wheeler retainers. Yet, you do not currently possess a velocipede, and have not possessed one for some time. Throughout your court, rumors have long been circulating as to the reason why, and everytime you travel abroad on horse, the rumors only intensify.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_warbike_yes;Send for a velocicraftsman at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_no;A horse travels just fine, thank you very much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_warbike_frame;The precise design of a velocipede is a secret kept closely by their crafters, but anyone can tell that the key element is its frame. Most velocipede frames are constructed from wood such as redwood or bamboo. However, the best and most expensive velocipedes take after pre-Event designs, and are constructed from the ancient metals that were left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_warbike_aluminiumframe;Only the bitter-steel of the old world is suitable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_redwoodframe;Redwoods grow but for one purpose!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_bambooframe;A sturdy bamboo frame is suitable enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_ironframe;Wood is too flimsy! Surely iron is best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_warbike_wheels;Second only to the frame is a velocipede's wheels. Before the Event, velocipede wheels were surfaced with rubber, and even today many lords of California choose to buy rubber from over the seas for just this purpose. Most velocipedes, however, instead possess wheels surfaced with leather, providing for a cheaper but less reliable machine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_warbike_rubberwheels;The rubber farms of exotic lands exist only to fuel California's demand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_leatherwheels;It would be imprudent to purchase rubber when leather does about as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_nowheels;A wagon needs no tire, so why should a velocipede?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_warbike_chain;Last, but not least, the function of a velocipede is reliant on the chain that connects the drive-wheel to the pedals. The secrecy regarding the construction of velocipede chains is the key to the continued guild monopoly over velocipede production, and many craftsmen have tried and failed to replicate their lightweight yet durable design.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_warbike_customchain;The velocicraftsmen are wise, and I would be foolish to defy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPT_warbike_badchain;What nonsense! A chain is a simple task for a local blacksmith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC_warbike_finished;The day has finally arrived. After many long days of planning and a number of costly investments towards its construction, the craftsmen gather to present to you a prized artifact of Californian culture - your very own velocipede! Even the crudest velocipede would outshine a horse, and yours is no different. All that's left to do is name it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

These ancient walls are a relic of this savage age, constructed by wealthy coastal warlords to defend against other neighboring warlords. Nowadays, all they defend is grass and moss from the trampling feet of cattle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Wall protects over eight hundred miles of Californian coast and its highest point in [c_san_francisco.GetName] is over forty-five feet tall, causing most to consider it to be the largest man-made structure ever built, a testament to the might of California. The Wall itself consists of massive ramparts which serve to deter climbing, along with a series of evenly spaced watchtowers along its entire length and a net of stone naval barriers along important shorelines to deter landing. It remains to be seen whether or not the wall can be seen from the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
