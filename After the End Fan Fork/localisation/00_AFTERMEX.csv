BM_SOUTH_OF_THE_BORDER_DESC;The once-glorious Mexican Empire has been shattered: Left open to rebellion in the North due to constant incursions by the Californians, the imperial army was shattered by Luis "la Cucaracha" at the watershed Battle of Ojinaga. That loss allowed the Plan of Ixcateopan — a coalition of freedom-minded indigenous leaders in the South to enact their wish for dissolution of the Empire and self-rule. Meanwhile, the Cristero lords of the Bajío now whisper of a new Cristiada, to reclaim their home in the name of Cristo Rey. In the Southeast, the nascent Kingdom of Yucatán seems poised to usurp Mexico's position as the dominant power, but turmoil within and the Caribbean Empire without, stand in its way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SOUTH_OF_THE_BORDER_ERA_INFO;The once-glorious Mexican Empire has been shattered: Left open to rebellion in the North due to constant incursions by the Californians, the imperial army was shattered by Luis "la Cucaracha" at the watershed Battle of Ojinaga.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1325022;Once allies in the Plan de Ixcateopan that shattered the Mexican Empire, the Zapotecas and Mixtecas quickly found themselves at odds with each other over territorial disputes. After a brief conflict between the two peoples, the Zapoteca princess Pinopiaa and her sister, Nadxieelii, were offered offered up by their father as hostages to the Mixtecas as a pledge of peace. However, with the death of the Zapoteca king and no male heir, Pinopiaa now must return to Oaxaca to be queen of her people. But will her love and marriage to a Mixteca prince allow her to free her sister from captivity, or will it doom her bloodline and her people to subjugation by the Mixtecas?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1810083;The house of Iturbide descends from Julián "el Grande", the legendary Jefe Máximo of Mexico that was able to reclaim most of the lost lands of the empire, but the family has fallen on hard times by the year 2666. The current head of the Iturbides, Wenceslao I, rules over a vestigial state barely worthy of the name Mexico. Surrounded by heathens, rival caudillos, and squabbling principalities, it seems unlikely that the rulers of Mexico will ever be able to regain their former glory. Will Wenceslao defy the odds and reverse his dynasty's recent fortune, or is the empire doomed to be swallowed by the tides of history like its contemperaries from days long forgotten?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1810200;When he was a young man, King Luis was a member of the Dorados, the legendary company of vaqueros and cowboys that served as the empires most effective — and unruly — task force. While in the service, he found salvation in the holy Atom and convinced many of his compatriots and fellow disciples to embark on a holy conquest of Mexico. At the battle of El Paso, Luis "la Cucaracha" destroyed the Imperial Army and carved out a realm for himself south of the Rio Grande. However, King Louis is no longer a young man — he is now 80 years old, and it seems that he will soon become one with the Atom. Although his son Jesús seems like a worthy successor, some still fear that without Luis to guide it, this new kingdom is doomed to fall as quickly as it emerged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1910000;King Gastón of las Bajas is one of the few truly great rulers left in California. Although his personal habits leave something to be desired, nobody can deny that Gastón is one of the strongest and most skilled warriors in all of California. As the Empire of California continues its slow decline, Gastón finds himself in a unique position. Will Gaston be content with his current title, or will he shed his hedonism and use his unique gifts to aim for something... greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###########Religions########### 
 
fidencista;Fidencista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fidencista_DESC;The cult of "el Niño Fidencio" follows a pantheon of quasi-deities derived from Catholic saints and heroes of the past, who are ultimately subservient to God but powerful in their own right. These entities are called upon for guidance and can be communed with through ritualistic means, but the most faithful heirs to "el Niñito" can allow themselves to become possessed by the saints to perform miracles and act as a conduit to allow the divine to directly influence the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fidencista_FEATURES;§Y*§!Homosexual Fidencistas are allowed to marry other homosexual characters.\n§Y*§! Kings and emperors are expected to become "Cajitas" — Those who play host to the most revered spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
sacred_heart;Sagrado Corazón;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sacred_heart_DESC;The "Missionaries of the Sacred Heart" combine traditions of the old Catholic church with an eagerness to incorporate local traditions and saints into the faith — even going as far as to elevate the angel of death to a quasi-deity. While this adaptability has allowed the religion to quickly take root in the religious chaos of Mexico, it has caused great divergence from the other Catholic splinter churches who now regard the faithful as polytheistic heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sacred_heart_FEATURES;§Y*§!Homosexual followers of La Santa Muerte are allowed to marry other homosexual characters. \n§Y*§! May experience visions of the Blessed Virgin called Marian Apparitions.\n§Y*§! La Santa Muerte demands respect for the dead and can be called on to help exact revenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
cristo_rey;Cristo Rey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cristo_rey_DESC;The Prelature of Cristo Rey — Christ the king — was organized to hold the splintering Church in Mexico together in the face of heathenry. In time, the Prelature filled the void of a strong church leadership and assumed de-facto control of the ordinal functions of the Catholic Church of Mexico, declaring the other Catholic successor churches heretical farces. In the absence of what they see as a legitimate pope, the Cristeros have elevated their Prelado — or Prelate — to a position of steward of the church who assumes many of the sacred duties of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cristo_rey_FEATURES; §Y*§!Can prepare campaigns known as §YCristiadas§! against heathen religions within the de jure borders of the Empire of Mexico \n§Y*§! May experience visions of the Blessed Virgin called Marian Apparitions.\n§Y*§! May expend Piety to raise units of zealots during a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

reformista;Reformista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reformista_DESC;The Reformista faith has its origins in the idea that belief should not be controlled by a strict Church. Beneméritos of old have tried to bring these ideals to fruition, the latest being Benemérito José Elías, who liberalized the structure of belief, opening up the Church to popular devotions without restriction. The fate of people's souls is far too important to be decided by priests who know not their flock. Thus, it is imperative that the Church have a protector who knows the needs of its people well and is not distracted by lofty pursuits and rigid hierarchies. By God and Liberty, the Benemérito is the one who must lead as only through respecting the various beliefs of others, can there be peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
purificador;Purificador;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
purificador_DESC;Purificadores — Purifiers — are a loosely organized christian doctrine that has its roots in pentecostal missions established not long before the Event. They believe that the faith's arrival to Central America was the first seal of the Apocalypse being broken. Such is their eschatology, that they identify even their fellow Christians as the prophesied Whore of Babylon. Their fundamentalist views on the Bible make them reject all other faiths as idolatrous and satanic, and they are willing to make them see their error, by force if needed — For those who are taken into the family of God, shall be gifted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
penitente;Penitente;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
penitente_DESC;Penitentes — Penitents — are so called because they believe that after the Event, the world was given a second chance at redemption — which must be atoned for with sorrowful and extenuant rituals that were once reserved for the holiest of weeks — as now every week must be Holy. The Penance that must be performed can be as little as praying, face to the floor, to being honored pallbearers of enormous images from the Passion of Christ. These traditions make them a disciplined people, capable of doing anything for their brothers in sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
moravian;Unitas Fratrum;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moravian_DESC;Unitas Fratrum, or "Unity of the Brethren", is a Christian church whose message of reformation and unity quickly took root in Central America in the wake of the Event. The Unitas Fratrum, who owes its origin in Central America to ancient missions in La Moskitia, cherishes its unity as a valuable treasure entrusted to it by the Lord as it represents the oneness of all humankind in the Body of Christ. Therefore the ecumenical movement is of its very lifeblood — permitting the incorporation of many traditions and structures with its middle-ground theology under the guidance of the Church. For a millennia, it has pointed towards the unity of the scattered children of God that they may become one in their Lord.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
navegante;Navegante;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
navegante_DESC;Navigants believe those who are brave, those who are patient, are blessed by the sea. Legends warn of the dangers and curses beneath the rolling waves, our Saviour and Provider calls us to walk over the waters to his grace so he may gift us our daily Manna of the Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
mesoamerican_gods;Indigenous Mexican;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
mictlantec;Mictlanteca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mictlantec_DESC;Mictlanteca is a continuation of ancient indigenous traditions and maintains that the keeper of the underworld had mercy after the complete destruction of Humanity in the previous cycle and guided them back to the land of the living. According to the Mictlantecos, the destruction of the last cycle was the result of the neglect and abandonment of sacrifice to spiritual entities known as dueños" — the true "owners" of the land who dwell in the hills", springs, caves, and other natural features that dot the landscape. The Mictlantecos believe that the equilibrium of life requires death and that a regular practice of the ancient sacrifices and rituals is necessary to maintain the balance of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mictlantec_FEATURES;§Y*§! May go on vision quests with the aid of sacramental herbs.\n§Y*§! Mictlantecos may sacrifice animals to the Dueños.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
sol_invicta;Sol Invicto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_invicta_DESC;Sol Invictistas believe that at the end of the second era, the Serpent covered the world in darkness and chaos. To combat this evil, the Sun clothed his wife, the Moon, in his fiery raiment as she gave birth to a son who would be sent to vanquish the evil. Like the instruction and final great sacrifice of the second Messiah, this Messiah of the third era, the Son of the Sun, devoted his life to creating the Seven Seals and rituals that trap the Serpent in the underworld and keep the darkness at bay. As successor of this final Messiah, the Gran Hijo del Sol and his Guardians must keep ever viligant and maintain the seals through proper worship of God the Sun - the Sol Invicto - lest the Serpent return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_invicta_FEATURES;§Y*§! The Gran Hijo del Sol is elected using the same mechanics as the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
 
lamanita;Lamanita;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lamanita_DESC;The history of the Latter Day Saints in Central America began not long before the Event, as Elder missionaries came to preach the message of Prophet Joseph Smith to the Lamanites. They firmly believe that the events described in the Book of Mormon happened in Central America, mixing the veneration of ancestors and exalted figures who were mistaken as gods in the past. An ancient prophecy holds that the Lamanites 'shall blossom as a rose', and they are keen to see its fulfillment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

furiegi;Furiegi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
furiegi_DESC;Furiegi — the Prayers — are the ancestral beliefs of the Garifuna, syncretized with Mormon theology introduced by missionary work. Furiegi differs from the Lamanite Church in structure and practice, with a priority on traditional matriarchal authority, and a purely ritual use of alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###########Government########### 
 
 
mex_imperial_government;Ancient Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mex_imperial_government_desc;The leaders of the Mexican Empire have long claimed that their system of governance is a direct continuation of the administration of Old Mexico. While their claim is unverifiable, it is unquestionable that their system retains many of the qualities of centralized government that Old Mexico possessed. In this system, all land and water within imperial territory is originally owned by the crown, who has the right to transfer this ownership to particular. Hence, private property is a privilege created by the Emperor. This permits the Emperor to grant and revoke titles at will.;;;;;;x
# mex_elective;Dedocracia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# succ_mex_elective;Dedocracia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# succ_mex_elective_desc;The Mexican Empire follows an ancient tradition of succession in which the Benemérito must secretly select his heir — known as the "Tapado" and then reveal him in a ceremony known as "el Destape." During the ceremony, the Benemérito points to his chosen successor and the most powerful individuals of the realm must decide whether to accept the charge or to defy his wishes and nominate their own candidate. Only commanders of the Empire, the Benemérito's council and immediate family are able to be selected as the "Tapado" and care should be taken in the selection — as the secrecy of the process is vital to the stability of the Empire. Should one discover who is to be the nextBenemérito, the cunning minds of the court of Mexico may be able to undermine the Empire with their ambitions.;;;;;;x
