EVTNAMEDORA.100;The Dorados;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.100;Originating as marauding bandits and developing into a powerful political force in themselves, the Dorados bent the knee to the Benemérito after falling to his armies, promising to serve him and la República to the end of time. For as long as la República has existed;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.100;¡Viva México!;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.101;[From.GetFirstName], the most enlightened Benemérito, has decreed the reestablishment of the Dorados, a volunteer force dedicated to defending la República and it's Emperor. Claiming to be the successors of an ancient group of revolutionaries, the Dorados progressed from marauding Northern bandits to a powerful realm in their own right. After being subjugated by the Republic's mighty armies, they bent the knee and promised to serve Mexico until the end of time. Repressed after the conquests of their former brother, the Cockroach of the North, the Benemérito has once again opened it's ranks to all who seek adventure and glory...;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.101;Interesting happenings in Chilangolandia...;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.105;Not on my watch!;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.105;Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has decided that he wants to find adventure in Mexico and join up with the Dorados. There is a good chance of prestige and glory, but he may not come back alive.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBDORA.105;Make me proud son!;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.107;A grizzled old warrior having just returned from Mexico arrived with a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName] today. Though he has left the Dorados, your son has apparently found himself a Mexican wife and decided to remain in Mexico City and build a new life there. It is doubtful whether you will ever see him again... ;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.107;My son....;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.108;After finishing his service with the Dorados, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has married a local woman and decided to remain in Mexico City instead of returning home to the land he once came from. He has pledged his continued service to you.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.108;Well, alright...;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.110;A heavily scarred warrior clad in Mexican-made armor approaches your throne, and before he can be disarmed, the stranger relieves your guard of his spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but you raise your hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from Mexico!;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.110;[From.GetFirstName]! You've... changed! ;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.112;Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has finally returned home from Mexico and his service with the Dorados, but he is not alone! He has brought with him... a woman, and a bastard, and years of experience in seduction. He asks that you provide lodging for them, and even as you get them settled he is already flirting with one of the serving girls.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.112;Let's hope this child doesn't cause any problems... ;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.114;An unassuming, robed monk is led into your throne room, and your guards explain that he just arrived on a caravan coming from Mexico City. You do not recognize him at first, but he identifies himself as [From.GetFirstName], your beloved son! He explains that in the horrors of war, he has seen the light, and has eschewed the pursuit of power to seek God.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.114;I had hoped you would have sought some sense... ;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.116;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful career in the Dorados! He fought in several battles, and learned much from the clever strategies and tactics favored by the bureaucrat-armies of the Silla Presidencial.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.116;Tell me of your battles, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.118;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Mexico and the Dorados, but he refuses to speak of his experiences there. You know he took part in several battles and killed many foes, but instead of reveling in the glory of his accomplishments, [From.GetFirstName] is plagued by nightmares and jumps at sudden sounds.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.118;Strange...;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.120;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from Mexico and his service with the dORADOS, but he is not alone. He has found a Greek wife and brought her with him. She is not familiar with our customs or language, and the climate does not seem to agree with her, but she seems willing to make the best of her new home.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.120;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.122;After many years in Mexico, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from his service to the Dorados and returned home. Your son is a changed man, however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and he instead speaks incessantly of this "Christ the King" and the need to defend his people from the heathens.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.122;May the gods have mercy...;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.124;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Mexico and the Dorados as a changed man. He is wiser, more confident in his own abilities and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent in Mexico did him good.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.124;Welcome home, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.126;Several former have recently returned home after serving the Eastern Emperor, and they bring news most grave. Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], fell in battle while campaigning in the East. They assure you that he faced his enemy with bravery and slew many before their numbers overwhelmed him..;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.126;He died a hero...;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.128;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from Mexico amidst a caravan filled with the spoils of war! Apparently the Benemérito is generous to those who serve him well, and there is gold here from all over the Mexico, Central America and beyond. Your son insists on sharing these riches with you, his loving father.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.128;[From.GetFirstName], you make me proud!;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.129;Upon learning of the death of your father, you left the Scholae Palatinae and departed Mexico for home alongside a caravan filled with loot from your campaigns. It was a long and perilous journey back, but your feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is your birthright. The throne is yours.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.129;It is as I remember it.;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.134;After many years in Mexico, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from his service to the Dorados and returned home. Your son is a changed man, however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and he instead speaks incessantly of this "Atomos" and his glory. He also seems to have a strange glow about him...;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.134;Heavens have mercy...;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDORA.136;After many years in Mexico, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from his service to the Dorados and returned home. Your son is a changed man, however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and he instead prances about, consorting with prostitutes and tax-collectors, and throwing mangoes at passerby, wherever he even gets those from. Still, he does seem to have a certain... mystic touch.;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTADORA.136;Heavens have mercy...;;;;;;;x
