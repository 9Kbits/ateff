#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;As the hall finds itself filled by dozens of members of local nobility alongside their families it dawns upon you the barbeque has begun. You pace back and forth in a backroom, mentally preparing for the words you will inevitably have to exchange with these people, until eventually you peek out into the main hall and see that the majority of them are partaking in the merriment, generously provided on your behalf. All the pieces are set, with these fellow nobles satisfied from fine meals and fine wine your potential to maneuver the situation to your benefit is at its greatest. You enter the main room, ready to deliver a speech before the crowd...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_minor_meeting;You draw the crowd's attention from your reserved seat at the feast table's head, and instantly every eye in the room is on you. Your nerve nearly slips, but you go right into your prepared speech. Minutes pass, and the crowd remains silent as they hang on every syllable that exits your mouth as you speak about yourself and what they now believe to be your almost countless qualifications for the prestigious title of Senator. Finally, as you finish your speech with an ancient and famous quote, there is a silence, and then an applause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_minor_meeting;You draw the crowd's attention from your reserved seat at the feast table's head, and instantly every eye in the room is on you. Your nerve nearly slips, and then it does. Your thoughts become inconsistent and you forget large parts of the speech you had memorized beforehand, but you substitute those parts well enough so as to not seem insane. Your speech ends on a fairly forgettable note. Your scalp begins to burn in embarrassment but quickly cools when you realize most of the barbeques attendees had either stopped paying attention at this point or never started, more interested in their drinks, meals, or prior conversations than whatever it is you stumbled through.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_minor_meeting;You draw the crowd's attention from your reserved seat at the feast table's head, and instantly every eye in the room is on you. Your nerve slips so fast you don't even realize how wildly you're jumping between the handful of bullet points you had memorized beforehand. The sheer pressure from both the utter silence of the hall and seeing everyone's eyes upon you causes you to stutter several times. You think you hear muffled laughter during one of your pauses. You manage to conclude your speech in a way you only realize afterwards sounds like a dirty joke. The silent room stays silent for multiple seconds too long, and you can see the previously lively room drain of color.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_merchants;As you begin your day, you hear word that a small group of traveling merchants of trinkets and oddities have arrived in your territory, looking for new locations to ply their goods. They seem to have already set up a stall in the nearest market, selling whatever it is that they've carried with them. There could be quite the benefit from speaking with them personally, not only would a good deal with these wanderers bring some small amount of prosperity, but if you play your cards right they may even spread word of you and impress some voters. Of course that also runs the risk of merely annoying them, you know nothing of these people but perhaps they won't take kindly to you bothering them. Nevertheless you are presented with an opportunity and ponder what exactly to do with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_merchants;Pay them a visit, see if you can't arrange some sort of deal with them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_merchants;Dress finely to impress them and welcome them to [ROOT.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_merchants;Best to not interfere with their dealings, leave them to sell their goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_merchants;Evidently, the traveling merchants are quite impressed with your lands, they've sold out their stock and your business-minded courtiers are abuzz with the possibility of attracting more of their kind. The people of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] proudly show off the various trinkets they've purchased. Their leader even stops by your court, wishing to speak with you. He compliments your people and promises that he'll be back someday, and adds that he'll make sure to recommend your lands to any of his friends he comes across. Not only do your people benefit from such an arrangement, but you also look quite good in the eyes of the voters for attracting new business. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_merchants;The merchants who recently have come to your lands seem to have made a decent enough profit, though by all reports they were very eager to leave [ROOT.Capital.GetName] and get back onto the roads. Your citizens have enjoyed the visit and those who made some purchases are in good enough cheer, but nothing especially notable happened during their short stay. You suppose there wasn't much else you could have hoped for, they've been through dozens of places just like yours and have moved on from each one, why would [ROOT.Capital.GetName] be any different? While you didn't manage to impress the merchants in the process, you still managed to come off as at least somewhat business minded, perhaps that will be enough to sway some voters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_merchants;Evidently, the traveling merchants who've come into town find [ROOT.Capital.GetName] rather disagreeable. After several incidents in town including a particularly nasty bar fight involving two of the merchants and a local troublemaker, the whole caravan has packed up their goods and left town, cursing your name and threatening to warn others to avoid these accursed lands. It may not harm your existing prosperity, but you're left with nothing to show for the whole situation other than a few broken barstools and disappointment. You can already imagine some amongst your rivals laughing at your expense, both at your inability to provide proper hospitality and the wild tales being told of your people's misconduct, which reflects rather poorly on you as their ruler, and as an extension, your electability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_merchants;A vote for [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName] is a vote for prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_merchants;Business as usual on the campaign trail then...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_merchants;You suppose it was all a rather poor investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_rangers;It seems some rangers have come into town, which is not an entirely unusual or noteworthy event in and of itself, and one you may have ignored to better focus on your campaign but these particular rangers have already made quite a reputation for themselves amongst the people of [ROOT.Capital.GetName], and not a pleasant one. You're presented with a string of complaints about their conduct ranging from claims they cheat at cards or refuse to pay for drinks to plots to seduce various young ladies and even one story about a missing pig that they supposedly killed and cooked. You can't say for sure what is true and what is only imagined, but one thing is very clear, the people of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] are sick and tired of these troublemakers and turn to you to deal with them. It also presents an opportunity to look like a strong ruler, a reputation that would help your chances at election. Luckily for you, several of them were arrested last night after threatening a shopkeeper, giving you a good opportunity to deal with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_rangers;I'll have to speak to these rangers, hopefully they can be calmed down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_rangers;Make an example out of them, to show everyone who's in charge here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_rangers;I go with the local [ROOT.GetPriestTitle], and try to convince them of the duties to civilization and to [ROOT.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_rangers;It seems your efforts have paid off, no more complaints from that town come in. Whether from absence of the troublemakers or a change of spirits the rangers in town now are acting much more civilized, some even make quick apologies to various people they've offended. There still is a case or two of public drunkenness but the people of [ROOT.Capital.GetName] breathe a sigh of relief that the worst trouble is over from those rowdy rangers. Having so quickly and effectively dealt with them both makes your people happy with you, but also makes you look like a strong leader who is capable of making sure the law is obeyed, something you make sure to make clear to any prospective voters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_rangers;Evidently not much can be done with the group of rowdy rangers from out of town. You had hoped to dissuade them from further antics but they hadn't cared much, continuing their troublemaking until your people had enough. Some local men, fed up with these outsiders, gathered a posse and ran them out of town. It does solve the problem, but not through any of your efforts, which your people don't seem to exactly blame you for but it doesn't reflect well on you to not be able to deal with such matters personally. Eventually things return to normal and the incident is mostly forgotten about. Your reputation amongst the voters remains more or less unchanged, but you haven't exactly impressed anyone with your rulership.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_rangers;Things don't go nearly as well as you had hoped, instead of toning down their escapades, they escalate them. It started with a drunken duel with one of your citizens that night, the ranger beat the other man half to death for no reason other than the man looked at him funny. From there, the rest of their little gang turned their antics into a reign of terror. What followed was a night of bar fights, a prison break to free their friends, two robberies, and an incident involving a guardsman's horse with women's undergarments on it's head. Eventually your guardsmen were able to regain control and arrest the troublemakers once and for all, but the entire night left a deep mark on the minds of your people, who saw your attempts to fix things completely fail and make things worse. It will take a long time for you to live this down, and until then the story of the Rowdy Rangers has become the laughingstock of the land. Unfortunately, that means plenty of people who might have voted for you also hear about the incident, making you look weaker as a candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_rangers;Vote [ROOT.GetBestName] for peace and quiet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_rangers;Keeping the peace is hard work...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_rangers;You can already hear [opponent name] shouting "[ROOT.GetTitledFirstName] is weak on crime";;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger;Recently, there's been talk of a once-proud ranger family that have fallen on hard times, their debts have caught up to them and the family patriarch had to sell most of the familys property to stay afloat, now after what was left of their herd died of sickness theyre on the verge of losing everything. Truely a sorry state of affairs, but perhaps you can do something about it. While most people at court merely shake their heads in pity, you see the chance to help these people and, perhaps more cynically, potentially look very electable in the process. Even if they get back on their feet, its unlikely this one family would be able to do too much to help you win the election, but if youre seen as generous and helpful to those whove fallen on bad times, it may win you some support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_destitute_rangers_help;I'll show generosity, this family is in desperate need of charity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_destitute_rangers_encourage;Offer some public words of encouragement, motivate them to keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_destitute_rangers_organize;Perhaps I can inspire others at court to help, and make myself look like a leader in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#resolution
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_good;Your methods pays off, and the family slowly begins to recover. They have managed to pay off most of their debt and purchased the start of what will be a new herd of cattle, finally regaining their dignity as rangers. It may take them some time to fully regain their former status, but it's more than just a forlorn hope now. The family patriarch personally thanks you and promises to spread word of the kindness and generosity you've shown him and his family. He even tells you that he'll be sure to spread word of the help you've given them. You can't help but notice that the story tugs at the heartstrings of many at court, and will hopefully show the voters of the realm that you're a generous leader worthy of their votes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_good;Help [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName] help yourself! Vote [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_neutral;The ranger family manages to more or less stay afloat thanks to what token help they've received after you took an interest in them. They manage to at least pay the interest on their debt but little more than that, their hopes of purchasing new cattle to make up for their lost herd is at the moment nothing more than a dream. They may be saved from complete ruin but the next few years will be hard indeed, and with no cattle to call their own they can barely call themselves rangers anymore. You've done what you can, and the family is thankful enough, but there is not much hope for them at present and you doubt any voters will be especially impressed, but you have kept a once proud family off of the streets and that is worth something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_neutral;How will they financially recover from this?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_bad;Perhaps you overestimated how much help you could provide the ranger family down on their luck, or perhaps their debt was just too high, and their income too low. Nevertheless your efforts to help this once proud family have come to naught, just yesterday they were forced to sell the last of their possessions, including the old estate that every single one of the family was born and raised in, in order to appease the debt collectors. Stripped of their land, their cattle, and anything else that was worth something to them, the family all but falls apart in their grief. You had sought to help these people, but now you watch them walk away into the horizon with their heads hung low in shame and defeat. Even more unfortunate is how people have been looking at you since, it seems some among your peers see your failure to help these people as disqualifying to the position you've been campaigning for, and the voters you tried to impress with your generosity have only been disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_destitute_ranger_resolve_bad_worse;It seems your words of encouragement were worse than useless. Your token efforts to help this once proud family have come to naught, just yesterday they were forced to sell the last of their possessions, including the old estate that every single one of the family was born and raised in, in order to appease the debt collectors. Stripped of their land, their cattle, and anything else that was worth something to them, the family all but falls apart in their grief. You had sought to help these people, but now you watch them walk away into the horizon with their heads hung low in shame and defeat. Even more unfortunate is how people have been looking at you since, it seems some among your peers see your failure to help these people as disqualifying to the position you've been campaigning for, and the voters you tried to impress with your generosity have only been disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_bad_worse;They should have pulled themselves up by their boostraps... if they had any.;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters;While normally you employ a number of men to patrol the range in your name, as you cannot exactly be everywhere at once, you have decided that it would be good to devote some time to riding around your territory yourself to show your attentiveness as a ruler to those who may yet vote for you. It is on one of these patrols that you encounter something that you didn't expect. It's not exactly unheard of for squatters, outlaws, and various other vagrants to set up small hideouts or even the occasional house in the lesser used portions of the range, but you hadn't expected to come across what seems to a ramshackle home built only a few days ride from [ROOT.Capital.GetName] nor did you expect the sheer size or evident poverty of the family living inside. A family which by all rights is here illegally. You are the legal lord of this land and these folks, no matter how desperate, are living off of and likely hunting game from land which does not belong to them. You are well within your rights to evict this family. It is in fact likely what is expected of you to do, you'd look weak if you simply let these people continue to evade the law, something that would no doubt be used by your detractors to slander you. You must do something, so you ponder your options.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_cash_help;These people can't stay here, but I can make sure they can afford a home elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_convince_unsafe;Perhaps I can convince them it's not safe to stay here.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_force_out;Why should I care for squatters, call my men to throw them out and tear down the home.;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_good;The whole matter proves to be less troublesome than you hoped. The family, perhaps expecting to have to leave eventually, do not offer much resistance. They gather their possessions and begin heading off, perhaps to some other lord's lands, but they are no longer squatting in yours and when word spreads on how decisively you dealt with the issue, your reputation much improves. You seem to have impressed many of your peers, who likely also have dealt with squatters, and respect how you dealt with them. Regardless, you've likely won a few votes from this little incident, which to you is a happy enough ending as any.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_good;Vote [ROOT.GetTitledFirstName] to solve the realm's problems!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_neutral;It requires a bit more effort than expected, the family are attached to their little home, and are reluctant to leave. It takes almost half a day before they finally give up and begin to pack up their belongings and various kinsmen, and even longer for them to actually leave. But they do leave, mournfully and slowly they go down the road out of your lands, seeking a life in greener pastures perhaps. As you return you hear whispers about the incident, and your conduct. Opinions are mixed, some think you could have done more while others seem to blame you for throwing them out, but it seems your decision was somewhat controversial. Luckily none of your courtiers can exactly agree on why they disagree and the mutterings don't escalate. You haven't exactly won any new respect as a ruler but beyond that not much has changed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_neutral;Who would have known dealing with vagrants would be so complicated.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_range_squatters_bad;The family takes your efforts to send them away very poorly. When they hear of your decision, one of the elder sons of the family approaches you and all but begs you to let them stay, when that doesn't work he comes at you with his fists but one of your guardsmen knocks him down before he can reach you. From there matters quickly devolved. A half dozen of the menfolk, and two women, rush to grab whatever they can use as weapons to protect their home, pitchforks, improvised spears and even a rusty old saber are brandished at you and your men, daring you to come and drag them out by force. Not wanting to cause a massacre during the election, you order your men to disperse them non-lethally, but even that leads to a brawl that leaves three of your soldiers injured and one of the women who took up arms dead. The remaining squatters left conscious stare at you with hate in their eyes as they're led out at saberpoint by your guardsmen and arrested. When you return home the tales your guardsmen tell don't exactly paint you favorably, and word spreads of your brutality. To make matters worse later that week you hear the incident used as a reason why you're unfit as a candidate, and it seems many voters seem to agree with the sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_destitute_ranger_bad;It's not land to freely build an estate on, I couldn't have just let them stay!;;;;;;;;;;;x
