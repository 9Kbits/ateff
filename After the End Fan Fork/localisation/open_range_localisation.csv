#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;As the hall finds itself filled by dozens of members of local nobility alongside their families it dawns upon you the barbeque has begun. You pace back and forth in a backroom, mentally preparing for the words you will inevitably have to exchange with these people, until eventually you peek out into the main hall and see that the majority of them are partaking in the merriment, generously provided on your behalf. All the pieces are set, with these fellow nobles satisfied from fine meals and fine wine your potential to maneuver the situation to your benefit is at its greatest. You enter the main room, ready to deliver a speech before the crowd...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;Move the crowd with an emotional personal story;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;Flatter yourself before the crowd;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTV_orfelec_problem_minor_meeting;Try to say whatever they want to hear, however they want to hear it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_minor_meeting;You draw the crowd's attention from your reserved seat at the feast table’s head, and instantly every eye in the room is on you. Your nerve nearly slips, but you go right into your prepared speech. Minutes pass, and the crowd remains silent as they hang on every syllable that exits your mouth as you speak about yourself and what they now believe to be your almost countless qualifications for the prestigious title of Senator. Finally, as you finish your speech with an ancient and famous quote, there is a silence, and then an applause!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_minor_meeting;You draw the crowd's attention from your reserved seat at the feast table’s head, and instantly every eye in the room is on you. Your nerve nearly slips, and then it does. Your thoughts become inconsistent and you forget large parts of the speech you had memorized beforehand, but you substitute those parts well enough so as to not seem insane. Your speech ends on a fairly forgettable note. Your scalp begins to burn in embarrassment but quickly cools when you realize most of the barbeques attendees had either stopped paying attention at this point or never started, more interested in their drinks, meals, or prior conversations than whatever it is you stumbled through.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_minor_meeting;You draw the crowd's attention from your reserved seat at the feast table’s head, and instantly every eye in the room is on you. Your nerve slips so fast you don’t even realize how wildly you’re jumping between the handful of bullet points you had memorized beforehand. The sheer pressure from both the utter silence of the hall and seeing everyone’s eyes upon you causes you to stutter several times. You think you hear muffled laughter during one of your pauses. You manage to conclude your speech in a way you only realize afterwards sounds like a dirty joke. The silent room stays silent for multiple seconds too long, and you can see the previously lively room drain of color.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_minor_meeting;The [Root.GetParty] cause has sway!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_minor_meeting;Could have been worse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_minor_meeting;By [Root.GetHighGodNameCap] the embarrassment might just kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x


#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_merchants;As you begin your day, you hear word that a small group of traveling merchants of trinkets and oddities have arrived in your territory, looking for new locations to ply their goods. They seem to have already set up a stall in the nearest market, selling whatever it is that they've carried with them. There could be quite the benefit from speaking with them personally, not only would a good deal with these wanderers bring some small amount of prosperity, but if you play your cards right they may even spread word of you and impress some voters. Of course that also runs the risk of merely annoying them, you know nothing of these people but perhaps they won't take kindly to you bothering them. Nevertheless you are presented with an opportunity and ponder what exactly to do with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_merchants;Pay them a visit, see if you can’t arrange some sort of deal with them;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_merchants;Dress finely to impress them and welcome them to [capitalname];;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_merchants;Best to not interfere with their dealings, leave them to sell their goods.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_merchants;Evidently, the traveling merchants are quite impressed with your lands, they’ve sold out their stock and your business-minded courtiers are abuzz with the possibility of attracting more of their kind. The people of [capitalname] proudly show off the various trinkets they’ve purchased. Their leader even stops by your court, wishing to speak with you. He compliments your people and promises that he’ll be back someday, and adds that he’ll make sure to recommend your lands to any of his friends he comes across. Not only do your people benefit from such an arrangement, but you also look quite good in the eyes of the voters for attracting new business. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_merchants;The merchants who recently have come to your lands seem to have made a decent enough profit, though by all reports they were very eager to leave [capitalname] and get back onto the roads. Your citizens have enjoyed the visit and those who made some purchases are in good enough cheer, but nothing especially notable happened during their short stay. You suppose there wasn’t much else you could have hoped for, they’ve been through dozens of places just like yours and have moved on from each one, why would [capitalname] be any different? While you didn’t manage to impress the merchants in the process, you still managed to come off as at least somewhat business minded, perhaps that will be enough to sway some voters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_merchants;Evidently, the traveling merchants who’ve come into town find [capitalname] rather disagreeable. After several incidents in town including a particularly nasty bar fight involving two of the merchants and a local troublemaker, the whole caravan has packed up their goods and left town, cursing your name and threatening to warn others to ‘avoid these accursed lands.’ It may not harm your existing prosperity, but you’re left with nothing to show for the whole situation other than a few broken barstools and disappointment. You can already imagine some amongst your rivals laughing at your expense, both at your inability to provide proper hospitality and the wild tales being told of your people’s misconduct, which reflects rather poorly on you as their ruler, and as an extension, your electability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_merchants;A vote for [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is a vote for prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_merchants;Business as usual on the campaign trail then…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_merchants;You suppose it was all a rather poor investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#situation
EVTDESC_orfelec_problem_x;It seems some rangers have come into town, which is not an entirely unusual or noteworthy event in and of itself, and one you may have ignored to better focus on your campaign but these particular rangers have already made quite a reputation for themselves amongst the people of [capitalname], and not a pleasant one. You’re presented with a string of complaints about their conduct ranging from claims they cheat at cards or refuse to pay for drinks to plots to seduce various young ladies and even one story about a missing pig that they supposedly killed and cooked. You can’t say for sure what is true and what is only imagined, but one thing is very clear, the people of [capitalname] are sick and tired of these troublemakers and turn to you to deal with them. It also presents an opportunity to look like a strong ruler, a reputation that would help your chances at election. Luckily for you, several of them were arrested last night after threatening a shopkeeper, giving you a good opportunity to deal with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_orfelec_problem_x;I’ll have to speak to these rangers, hopefully they can be calmed down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_orfelec_problem_x;Make an example out of them, to show everyone who's in charge here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_orfelec_problem_x;I go with the local [Root.GetPriestTitle], and try to convince them of the duties to civilization and to [Root.GetHighGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#result
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_good_x;It seems your efforts have paid off, no more complaints from that town come in. Whether from absence of the troublemakers or a change of spirits the rangers in town now are acting much more civilized, some even make quick apologies to various people they’ve offended. There still is a case or two of public drunkenness but the people of [Root.Capital.GetName] breathe a sigh of relief that the worst trouble is over from those rowdy rangers. Having so quickly and effectively dealt with them both makes your people happy with you, but also makes you look like a strong leader who is capable of making sure the law is obeyed, something you make sure to make clear to any prospective voters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_neutral_x;Evidently not much can be done with the group of rowdy rangers from out of town. You had hoped to dissuade them from further antics but they hadn’t cared much, continuing their troublemaking until your people had enough. Some local men, fed up with these outsiders, gathered a posse and ran them out of town. It does solve the problem, but not through any of your efforts, which your people don’t seem to exactly blame you for but it doesn’t reflect well on you to not be able to deal with such matters personally. Eventually things return to normal and the incident is mostly forgotten about. Your reputation amongst the voters remains more or less unchanged, but you haven’t exactly impressed anyone with your rulership.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_orfelec_resolve_bad_x;Things don’t go nearly as well as you had hoped, instead of toning down their escapades, they escalate them. It started with a drunken duel with one of your citizens that night, the ranger beat the other man half to death for no reason other than the man looked at him funny. From there, the rest of their little gang turned their antics into a reign of terror. What followed was a night of bar fights, a prison break to free their friends, two robberies, and an incident involving a guardsman’s horse with women's undergarments on it’s head. Eventually your guardsmen were able to regain control and arrest the troublemakers once and for all, but the entire night left a deep mark on the minds of your people, who saw your attempts to fix things completely fail and make things worse. It will take a long time for you to live this down, and until then the story of the Rowdy Rangers has become the laughingstock of the land. Unfortunately, that means plenty of people who might have voted for you also hear about the incident, making you look weaker as a candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_good_x;Vote [playername] for peace and quiet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_neutral_x;Keeping the peace is hard work…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_orfelec_resolve_bad_x;You can already hear [opponent name] shouting ‘[playername] is weak on crime’;;;;;;;;;;;;x
