choose_evangelical_branch_desc;The changing centuries have pushed many antediluvian theological disagreements within the Evangelical church to purely academic corners, but some questions can't be asked without needing an answer. One such question is that of free will.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_hcc_colapse_holy_orders;The Evangelical Holy Orders;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hcc_colapse_holy_orders;With the collapse of the Holy Columbian Confederacy, protection of the Evangelical faith has fallen to its adherents. Several new brotherhoods have formed to defend the faith -- the Knights of Chrismon Tree, the Order of the Baptists, the Pentecostal Oathsworn -- all claiming some ancient lineage from long ago. They have joined alongside the Army of Salvation to protect good Evangelicals everywhere.;;;;;;;;;x

postadventist_DESC;The Postadventists emerged very early after the Event, believing it was the start of the Biblical Apocalypse. It was a compelling view that attracted thousands, but as time wore on, theologians and adherents alike wondered at the continued existence of the world. The consensus they reached -- after much infighting that culminated in the creation of a formal leadership -- was that the end of the world was postponed so that the Postadventists could create the Milennial Kingdom on Earth to usher in the rest of the apocalypse. Seeing the current state of the world as a recursive return to Biblical times, Postadventists do not consider anyone else to be Christian -- though the rest of the world acknowledges them as a distant relative of the Evangelicals. As such, the Postadventists wage holy wars on Catholics, Protestants, and pagans alike.;;;;;;;;;x
