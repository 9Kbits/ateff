#Bar Mitzvah Localizations ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_1;The day of [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName]'s Bar Mitzvah is soon approaching, and excitement builds in the palace. Your Rabbi [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] has offered to personally prepare [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim] in the final month, to read from the Torah and give a D'var Torah as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_1;[Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] will prepare my [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSonDaughter].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_barmitzvah_1;I can prepare [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] for the Bar Mitzvah myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_barmitzvah_1;[bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] can figure it out on [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES1_barmitzvah_2;The day has arrived. At your family's synagogue [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] approaches the bimah brimming with a regal confidence. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] reads [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] Torah portion effortlessly, followed by a D'var Torah on the portion that impresses even the most cynical of your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES2_barmitzvah_2;The day has arrived. At your family's synagogue [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] approaches the bimah shaking nervously. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] stumbles [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] way through the passage, constantly stopping for corrections from the gabbai. Your vassals cringe in pity as [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] attempts to deliver a clumsy D'var Torah clearly written the night before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_2;I'm so proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_barmitzvah_2;That fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_3;In the celebration after, you see [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] and [compliment_vassal.GetBestName] discussing intently some issue brought up in [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] D'var Torah, with [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] displaying a maturity you didn't realize [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHe] had. Afterwards [compliment_vassal.GetFirstName] pull you aside to tell you just how impressed [compliment_vassal.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_3;That's my [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSonDaughter]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_4;In the celebration after, you see [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] and [insult_vassal.GetBestName] arguing, when [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] suddenly jumps up out of [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] seat, flailing at [insult_vassal.GetFirstName] until your guards are able to pull [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim] away. [insult_vassal.GetFirstName] calls out to you: "is this how your family treats guests?".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_4;Ugh, what have you done [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_5;It seems as if [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] has started getting along incredibly well with the child of one of the visiting vassals! Indeed, apparently [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] and [befriended_child.GetBestName] are becoming fast friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_5;How lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_6;While having a pleasant conversation you are suddenly interrupted by an infernal ruckus, upon further investigation it seems as if [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] has gotten into a fight with the child of one of the visiting vassals! You tear the two children apart, but it is obvious that [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] and [rival_child.GetBestName] will not ever be friends after this encounter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_6;I wonder who started it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_7;As the hours go by you notice [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]'s mood starting to drop. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] is obviously still upset about the embarassment at [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] Bar Mitzvah. Hopefully this slump in [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]'s mood will pass soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_7;I should go help [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_8;After a long night of celebration, the Bar Mitzvah is finally over. After all the stresses of the day, [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] retires to [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] chambers and wishes you good night. For better or worse, you look on the child you raised, finally grown to adulthood, and wonder what [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] future will bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_8;I feel old...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
