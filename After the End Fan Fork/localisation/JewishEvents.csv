#Bar Mitzvah Localizations ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_1;The day of [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName]'s Bar Mitzvah is soon approaching, and excitement builds in the palace. Your Rabbi [Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] has offered to personally prepare [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim] in the final month, to read from the Torah and give a D'var Torah as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_1;[Root.job_spiritual.GetBestName] will prepare my [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSonDaughter].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_barmitzvah_1;I can prepare [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] for the Bar Mitzvah myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_barmitzvah_1;[bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] can figure it out on [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES1_barmitzvah_2;The day has arrived. At your family's synagogue [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] approaches the bimah brimming with a regal confidence. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] reads [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] Torah portion effortlessly, followed by a D'var Torah on the portion that impresses even the most cynical of your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDES2_barmitzvah_2;The day has arrived. At your family's synagogue [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] approaches the bimah shaking nervously. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] stumbles [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] way through the passage, constantly stopping for corrections from the gabbai. Your vassals cringe in pity as [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] attempts to deliver a clumsy D'var Torah clearly written the night before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_2;I'm so proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_barmitzvah_2;That fool!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_3;In the celebration after, you see [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] and [compliment_vassal.GetBestName] discussing intently some issue brought up in [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] D'var Torah, with [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] displaying a maturity you didn't realize [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHe] had. Afterwards [compliment_vassal.GetFirstName] pull you aside to tell you just how impressed [compliment_vassal.GetSheHe] is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_3;That's my [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSonDaughter]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_4;In the celebration after, you see [bar_mitzvah_target.GetBestName] and [insult_vassal.GetBestName] arguing, when [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] suddenly jumps up out of [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] seat, flailing at [insult_vassal.GetFirstName] until your guards are able to pull [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim] away. [insult_vassal.GetFirstName] calls out to you: "is this how your family treats guests?".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_4;Ugh, what have you done [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_5;It seems as if [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] has started getting along incredibly well with the child of one of the visiting vassals! Indeed, apparently [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] and [befriended_child.GetBestName] are becoming fast friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_5;How lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_6;While having a pleasant conversation you are suddenly interrupted by an infernal ruckus, upon further investigation it seems as if [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] has gotten into a fight with the child of one of the visiting vassals! You tear the two children apart, but it is obvious that [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] and [rival_child.GetBestName] will not ever be friends after this encounter...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_6;I wonder who started it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_7;As the hours go by you notice [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]'s mood starting to drop. [bar_mitzvah_target.GetSheHeCap] is obviously still upset about the embarassment at [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] Bar Mitzvah. Hopefully this slump in [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName]'s mood will pass soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_7;I should go help [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_barmitzvah_8;After a long night of celebration, the Bar Mitzvah is finally over. After all the stresses of the day, [bar_mitzvah_target.GetFirstName] retires to [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] chambers and wishes you good night. For better or worse, you look on the child you raised, finally grown to adulthood, and wonder what [bar_mitzvah_target.GetHerHis] future will bring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_barmitzvah_8;I feel old...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_yeshiva_friend;You and [chevruta_partner.GetFirstName] have became inseparable. You two go beyond just studying together, you have common jokes, common interests and similar minds. Your names go together in the rabbis mouths, and the other avrachs see you as one entity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_yeshiva_rival;The noise can be heard all over the Yeshiva. You and [chevruta_partner.GetFirstName] are at each other throats yet agan, disagreeing over interpertations.

EVTTITLE_RECITING_TORAH;The Wisdom of The Rebbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_1;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n A disciple once asked the Baal Shem Tov: "Why is it that one who clings to God and knows he is close to him, sometimes experiences a sense of interruption and remoteness?" \n The Baal Shem explained: "When a father sets out to teach his little son to walk, he stands in front of him and holds his two hands on either side of the child, so that he cannot fall, and the boy goes toward his father between his father's hands. But the moment he is close to his father, he moves away a little, and holds his hands farther apart, and he does this over and over, so that the child may learn to walk.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_2;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n Rabbi Pinhas of Koretz once said: "God's relationship to the wicked may be compared to that of a prince who, besides his magnificent palaces, owns all manner of little houses hidden away in the woods and in villages, and visits them occasionally to hunt or to rest. The dignity of a palace is no greater than that of such a temporary abode, for the two are not alike, and what the lesser accomplishes, the greater cannot. It is the same with the righteous man. Though his value and service be great, he cannot accomplish what the wicked man accomplishes in the hour he prays, or does something to honor God, and God who is watching the worlds of confusion, rejoices in him. That is why the righteous man should not consider himself better than the wicked.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_3;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n Rabbi Yehiel Mikhal once said: "It is written: 'Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? And who shall stand in His holy place?' For the sake of comparison, let us take a man who rides up a mountain in his carriage, and when he is half-way up, the horses are tired and he must stop and give them a rest. Now, whoever has no sense at this point, will roll down. But he who has sense will take a stone and put it under the wheel while the carriage is standing. Then he will be able to reach the top. The man who does not fall, when he is forced to interrupt his service, but knows how to pause, will get to the top of the mountain of the Lord.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TORAH_VERSE_4;A silence fills the room as the Rebbe clears his throat and begins to share some words of wisdom: \n Rabbi Shelomo of Karlin once said: "When he, who has done all the commandments of the Torah, but has not felt the blaze of holy ecstasy in so doing, comes to that other world, they open the gates of paradise for him. But because he has not felt the blaze of ecstasy in this world, he does not feel the ecstasy of paradise. Now, if he is a fool, and complains, and grumbles: 'And they make so much to-do about paradise!' he is instantly thrown out. But if he is wise, he leaves of his own accord, and goes to the tzaddik, and he teaches the poor soul how to feel ecstasy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_TISH_PARTY;Your servants bring out a sumptous feast arranged for your Rabbi and the other dignitaries on the high table: kugel filled with raisins and cinnamon, lamb tsimmes, goblets filled to the brim with wine. While many of the disciples ate their meals at home, the Rebbe passes out wine and food for each of them as shiyarim, each recieved with a personal blessing from the Rebbe. \n After the meal, the Rebbe begins with a slight voice, singing a wordless melody. Slowly his disciples begin to join in, the song building in passionate intensity as voices fill the great dining hall with music. Soon the young chassids are dancing on the tables, as their elders clap and sway in the benches!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
