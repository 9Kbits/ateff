EVTDESC_restore_mexican_empire_desc;A true relic of the past, the Mexican Empire has long claimed continuity with the ancient republic. However, centuries of mismanagement and religious strife led to the fracturing of the Empire. Many had believed that Mexico's time had finally come to an end. \n[Root.GetTitledFirstName] has proven them wrong. [Root.GetSubjectPronounCap] has brought the rogue realms of the caudillos back into the fold of the Empire and has brought a stability to the region not seen since Julián the Great. \nAlthough there is still territory left to be reclaimed and wars that have not yet been won, one thing is certain - Mexico is back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_fide_cajita;Divine Cajita;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FIDE_123;Fidencista nobles and peasants alike chafe beneath the yoke of an unworthy king. Why should they bend the knee to a common tyrant, when the materias tell them El Niño's inheritors can truly rule in God's will through mantling his most holy saints? To rule effectively, you must be declared a Cajita: the vessel through which a divine spirit or saint acts with a mandate to bring the necessary salvation to humanity.\n\n In order to become an inheritor to El Niño's legacy, you must cleanse yourself in a fast in the desert and bathe in blessed muds so that your heart is pure enough that the divine may enter.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_FIDE_125;The days pass and your stomach grumbles, begging you to abandon your holy quest and with it, your chance of becoming a worthy vessel of the divine. As you traverse the landscape you realize you recognize the area and a town lays not that far from your current location. Surely they could spare a meal for their liege should they be called upon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You enter the pool and allow yourself to be blessed and submerged by the Materias who then help you out of the pool so that you can continue crawling in humility to the holy shrine of the saints. At the shrine, you rise to light the votive candle of the spirit who will fill your soul with their grace.\n\nYou light the candle of...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_destape_1;With the Tapado selected, the utmost discretion must be taken to maintain the secrecy of their identity. Should one learn of who he or she may be, the devious minds of the court of Mexico may seek to extort or plan their downfall. Instead, each must believe themselves to be the true Tapado up until the moment that the true heir is unveiled. Now you may begin to plan your succession, but be aware, if you call the "Destape" ceremony too early before your reign is ended, the powerful and the connected may try to place a selection of their own in the great Silla Presidencial as the next [From.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;x

The [From.GetTitle] gives a brief rehearsed speech and then points to [From.GetHerHis] chosen candidate, shaping the future of Mexico...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_destape_8;I am at the service of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_9;The [From.GetTitle]'s finger comes to rest in front of [From.GetHerHis] chosen successor. Thus, the veil is lifted and all can see who has been chosen to rule after the current [From.GetTitle]. The lines will quickly be drawn. Should this "Destapado" be supported as the ancient tradition dictates? or is another more worthy to lead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_destape_9;The ancient tradition must be upheld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_destape_9;I will not suffer this fool on the Silla Presidencial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_destape_10;The chamber is emptied after the usual mingling and political schmoozing, yet the dust has yet to settle. Will this choice persevere as has according to tradition? or will it fall prey to political machinations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
