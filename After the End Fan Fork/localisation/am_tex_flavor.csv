EVTDESC_tex_king_15;The Red Raider was the first to fight beside the future High Queen, and first of the unionist banner leaders to adopt her Americanist beliefs. Upon their defeat of the Highland Tyrant Marrion, he gave the first of the Banner Oaths that he would drive any enemy of the planned Grand Kingdom of Texas off of the Estacado. Until the Estacado is flattened the Oath remains to be taken up again and the banner re-raised.\n\nNow with the sponsorship of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], [d_red_raider.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn again that oath.

EVTDESC_tex_king_16;The Longhorns were the fourth banner to rally to the High Queen's cause, and the second non unionist one. Unlike other banners the Longhorns were a banner that held influence over texans across the entire Magnateship of Texas. Their political sway and power were such that with them supporting the High Queen she could defy the Magnate and hold a Bannerassembly, and that support they swore to use for the good of Texas. \n\nNow with the sponsorship of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], [d_longhorns.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn again that oath.

EVTOPTA_tex_king_17_banner_giver;I  am now one step closer to being elected High King;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_tex_king_17;The Aggies were One of the most faithful pre-High Queen banners. They firmly rejected the unionist philosophy and the Americanist faith its adherents adopted under the High Queen. This did not stop them from joining the High Queen before the congress of Banners. The Magnate had grown too corrupt for resolute and devout Aggies and despite their faith differences they were swayed by the conviction and bravy of the High Queen and believed her promise of restored rights.\n\nNow with the sponsorship of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], [d_aggies.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn again that oath.

EVTDESC_tex_king_18;The banner of the First Cav traces its martial might to before the event, and was one of the most outspoken Unionist Banners. Already skirting open revolt in response to the brutal repression of their unionist beliefs, the news of the arrival of the future High Queen and this new Americanist belief she had brought with her inspired the First Cav Bannercaptain to assemble his banner and ride out to support her. His oath pledged every blade under his Banner to defend the High Queen.\n\nNow with the sponsorship of [Root.GetTitledFirstName], [d_first_cav.Holder.GetTitledFirstName] has sworn again that oath.
