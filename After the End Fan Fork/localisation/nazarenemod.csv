nazarene;Nazarene;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nazarene_DESC;In the face of the conquests of Elton the Lawgiver, the Churches of the Nazarenes put aside the ancient doctrinal divides for the sake of their own survival. Adherents to this creed practice their own traditional forms of Christianity unmolested by their peers, and take part in the labyrinthine codes and civil systems of Californian society. The de facto spiritual leader of the Nazarenes is the Abbot of Saint Herman’s Monastery, who both settles disputes between the Christian branches and protects the holy places of the pilgrims and the libraries of the archivists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nazarene_FEATURES;Nazarene rulers may gain sympathy with Cetic by decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
true_cross;True Cross;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
true_cross_DESC;True Cross began as a isolationist strain of thought within California Christendom. Many church leaders bitterly resented the influence of the Eltonites and the seemingly lukewarm attitudes of their Christian brethren towards the influence of the Emperor. This smoldered into a pseudo-iconoclastic uprising which was quickly crushed by both mainline Christian and Imperial forces, driving the last of the zealots into the bandit-ridden mountains and isolated communities of the Sierra Nevada. They identify each other by the wearing of California Poppies and dream of the day when all of the Golden West may be under the shadow of the True Cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
