BM_FIAT_HOMO_DESC;The world suffered tremendously from the Event, but did not die out completely. Although scarred, the Earth still provides home for humanity. Now, in the midst of the 27th century, one part of the world is beginning to organize themselves, to rebuild and expand outward. Driven by greed, by righteousness, by bloodlust and by all the sins and virtues, rulers and adventurers will reshape the world. Let there be man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Seeking an enemy to unite the archipelago against, he embarked on an invasion of Confederate Florida in concert with their Tuskegean enemies. Meanwhile, a great army assembles in Quebec under the banner of St. Ursula, seeking to save the souls of New English from eternal damnation and perhaps gain worldly rewards in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In such a state, can the Indians survive in this new world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The mighty empire of California, which enjoyed centuries of stable rule over nearly all the west coast, has been thrown into chaos by six warring kingdoms, each desiring control over the Emperor and harboring their own ambitions, while the Cascadian kings struggle against Haida invaders, the Mormons of Deseret spread their faith northwards at swordpoint, and Arixan cowboys clash with Navajo, Hopi, and tinkers of the Atomicist faith. Can the peace so many sing about ever be restored to the region?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_SOUTH_OF_THE_BORDER_DESC;As Mictlantec and Jurihiata Ikikunari heathens consolidate their power in the Valley of Mexico, the followers of the Sacred Heart begin to call for a grand reconquista of the old Empire of Mexico. In the midst of this chaos, the merchants of Veracruz and Colima grow rich from trade between the Anglos and those further south. The Atom-worshipping lords of Sonora and Tejano conquerors of Sierra Madre must defend their conquests from those still loyal to the Sacred Heart. The Kingdom of Yucatan is strong, but dissension between Yucatecs and Mayas threatens it from within as the growing Caribbean Empire threatens it from without.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_1910107;California has seen better days. The Emperor has become a mere figurehead, with his former governors acting as independent rulers in all but name. Can you reunite California under its divinely-ordained ruler, or will disharmony and strife continue to reign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2000011;Marchioness Portia of Jamaica has built a great empire through conquest and diplomacy. But as she grows old, earls and marquises plot to break away or gain the throne for themselves, united only in hatred for the vile Prince Barrington. Worshippers of the orishas, the loa, and Jah are in constant conflict. Can you hold the Caribbean together, or will the Empire survive only as a historical footnote?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1788001;Hudsonia's fortunes have declined somewhat from its glory days under the Rodham kings. Although the realm is mostly united, the authority of the crown is weakened, and Baltus III Groot's reign is plagued by religious strife, disloyal vassals, Rodham claimants to the throne and the perpetual threat of Occultists to the east. Can you ride the storm and restore Hudsonia to its old strength, or are Baltus and his kingdom doomed to obscurity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1861001;305 years after its founding, the Holy Columbian Confederacy is one of the most powerful and stable realms east of the Mississippi, a cornerstone of chivalric culture in the Americas, and self-proclaimed successor to Old America. As its newest emperor, Algernon III has a lot to live up to, and the reality of power isn't the stuff of songs. In an empire beset with the threat of rebellion, constant intrigue in the halls of power, and religious turmoil foreign and domestic, can you prove yourself worthy to wear the crown?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1620100;Centuries ago, the House of Mahonic ruled a mighty, prosperous kingdom that united almost all the Northeast, and became a name known - and feared - by every living thing east of the Mississippi. Now, though, those days are but memories, living only in tomes from the great Crimson Library or the tales your father lulled you to sleep with during your childhood, and you are the last. The road before you is treacherous, but not hopeless - play your cards right, and maybe you can return your family, and your people, to their former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1788002;The Big Apple isn't anywhere near the grandeur of its pre-cataclysmic days, but it has survived and rebuilt, retaking its place as one of the Americas' economic and cultural capitals. Over the centuries, the Republic has braved war and calamity, even surrounded by the many factions of the tumultuous Northeast. You are the latest in a long line to guide the city that never sleeps, but beware: your fellow patricians are ambitious, Americanists have few friends among their neighbors, and war is almost more common in the region than trade. Will New York prosper under your rule, or is the great city doomed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1867007;Long ago, before the cataclysm that engulfed the ancient world, Ontario was capital to the empire of Canada, which counted itself among Old America's closest friends. Canada is long gone, but under the House of Laurier, Ontario has built itself anew, braving the storms that have beset its fellow Canadian kingdoms as well as the Northeast in general. Not all is well, however, as the Rust Cultists of the Midwest are a constant threat, as are the conflicts between the Canadian churches and the bloody, ever-changing politics of the eastern seaboard. Under By's reign, will Ontario continue its rise to greatness, or will the Canadian dream finally come to an end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1967004;Detroit, land of opportunity and home of the divine machines. Blessed be the city of the Old Machines, and blessed be the name of Overseer Coleman the Liberator, hero to his people and hero to his faith. Now free of the influence of its old Quebecois overlords, the Factory of Detroit stands triumphant and ready to unite the Rustic peoples. In the East and West, both the Ursulines and Catholics stand ready to stop a united Michigan at all costs, but Coleman, too, is ready to stand against them. Long live Detroit, love live the Liberator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1933005;Life on the border of the largest empire in the new world can be a profitable one... if you're an Evangelical Christian. Unfortunately for the political future of the tribe of Tenesi, High Chief Ellis is a zealous Revelationist who would not think of compromising his mystical ideals to placate his neighbors. A magnetic personality and dashing good looks may have allowed him to bring Revelationist lands under his control, but will it take a miracle to keep hold of his conquests in the face of Confederate domination?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2200017;The Emir Ammon-Jaffar made it his life's goal to take his sword up against the works of Yakub and the Dark Djinn. He has been rewarded by God with a nascent state in Suncoast and a very capable son, Ali. However, he is surrounded all sides by heretics - the Rats to his east, the Confederates to his north, and the hashish-smokers to his south. Will Ammon-Jaffar be able to forge a strong homeland for the Orientalists, or will the light of the Crescent moon be permanently vanquished by the enemies of Ali Baba?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3000000;The Latimer family of the Black March enjoy a place of privilege on the western frontier of the Holy Columbian Confederacy. Tasked with maintaining the security of the Magnolia Marches, Duke Huey faces threats on all sides: Papists to the northwest and devil-worshipping Occultists to the north, while Voodoo sorcerers revel in the remains of New Orleans. But youthful vigor, a just heart and God himself are on his side. The disparate communities on his borders will surely soon fall under the yoke of the true successor to old America!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1997018;Keenich Abram VII rules the Kingdom of Deitschrei, one of the oldest and most stable realms in all of Old America. Deitschrei has not seen war in over two hundred years, and it currently enjoys good relations with its fellow Anabaptists in the Kingdom of Hudsonia. However, Keenich Abram himself faces a rather serious problem. His wife, Keenichn Isidora, has not yet given him a child, and, at age 49, it seems certain that she never will. Will the Lengacher dynasty die with Keenich Abram, or will he find a way to keep his line alive, no matter the cost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1830006;Ammaron Anthophile is the King of Deseret and the King of All Mormons, both of which are extremely prestigious titles for any man. However, titles mean nothing if they aren't backed up with force. The Mormon faith is secluded, surrounded on all sides by pagans, and ignored by the Christian world. Deseret, though large, is a weak kingdom with only one major city. Ammaron must overpower his enemies, stand fast in his faith, and find an heir, alone and against all odds. The North and South borders must be secured to defend against potential invasions from California or a united Plains. The fate of Mormonism and his young kingdom hang in the balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2200016;Imam Zakariyya of Orange is head of the Imamite faith and the last scion of the great house Abbas that once ruled SoCal. As the Empire of California continues its slow decline, Zakariyya finds himself in a unique position. Will Zakariyya use the chance to investigate rumors of grand treachery and aim for a life beyond that of a mere vassal? Or will he, too, fade into dust as the last member of a once-great dynasty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1875001;In the years since the apocalypse, the Comanche have been one of the more successful groups of reemerging natives and have carved a large kingdom out of Old World Texas and Oklahoma, carrying on the warrior tradition of their forefathers. However, the Comanche only make up a small portion of their own kingdom's population, and unlike many other native groups, they fight for the Church. King Pahayoko II is young, ambitious, and a great fighter. The pagans in the West and in the South offer great expansion opportunities, Greater Comancheria and Texas remain to be united, and the church presents itself as a great tool. The future of the Comanche seems brighter than ever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1667035;Maskwa Pîwâpisk was given his first name, meaning "Bear", in honor of a legendary Cree leader from the distant past. However, Maskwa bestowed his second name, meaning "Iron", upon himself, to reflect the future which he intends to forge. Inspired by the great multi-ethnic Iron Confederacy that once claimed dominance over the northern Great Plains, Maskwa seeks to expand his already sizeable realm into one worthy of reclaiming that title, allowing both the Cree and the other nations of the Great Plains to stand as equals against those who would steal their lands and wealth. Will Maskwa succeed in his task, or will his ambitions be dented?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1200041;King Tsaa Hamjuuwee is the ruler of the great kingdom of Januug Tlag'áang, which occupies the coast of what was once British Columbia. The entire northwestern coast was once under the iron fist of a united Haida kingdom, and stood poised to conquer all the way down to California following the fall of the Freeland kingdom of Cascadia. However, an inheritance snafu caused the great Haida kingdom to be split in two, and you now rule just the kingdom of Januug Tlag'áang - Canuck Country. Will you turn your attention north to reunite the Haida, or will you forge a new empire for yourself along the southern coast?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1889001;Nearly two centuries ago, the area now known as Lakotah used to be home to a thriving Americanist empire centered at Rushmore. Times change, however, and the Sioux have now filled the previous power vacuum in the region. King Tasinagi Hokwoju is the first of these Sioux kings, having formed Lakotah 22 years ago. In the South, Catholics and the threat of holy war loom. In the East, the hostile Norsemen may soon unite and challenge Lakotah. But the Sioux are as resilient now as they were before the Event. They are warriors, and King Tasinagi won't let his young kingdom go gently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1810083;House Iturbide once ruled all of Mexico, but they have fallen on hard times by the year 2666. The current head of the Iturbides, Wenceslao I, rules over a vestigial kingdom barely worthy of the name "Mexico". Surrounded by heathen Mesoamericans, rival kings, and squabbling principalities, it seems unlikely that the rulers of Mexico will ever be able to regain their former glory. Will Wenceslao defy the odds and reverse his dynasty's fortune, or is Mexico doomed to stay shattered forever?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1875009;The Cherokee people were driven from their ancestral homeland centuries ago, and, unlike their Comanche neighbors, they have not yet reconquered it. The current leader of the Cherokee, Will-usdi, does not seem like the kind of ruler who will lead his people to glory - he is known for his complacent nature and his tendency to shy away from conflict. It looks like the Cherokee will stay in their neighbor's shadow for decades to come... unless Will-usdi can defy expectations and carry his tribe to new heights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1810200;When he was a young man, King Louis embarked on a holy conquest of Mexico in the name of the Atom. He carved out a realm for himself south of the Rio Grande, establishing a feudal kingdom in what was once a barren and desolate wasteland. However, King Louis is no longer a young man - he is now 73 years old, and it seems that he will soon become one with the Atom. Although his son Jesús seems like a worthy successor, some still fear that the Kingdom of Sierra Madre is doomed to fall to the worshippers of the Sacred Heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1800025;The Shareef of Guyana, Geert-Jan, won his throne in the fires of revolt against the former Hindu rulers of the kingdom. However, that was in the prime of his youth - the Shareef is now an aging man, disillusioned with his court and unconcerned with his family after a chunk of Guyanese territory, including his former capital, was annexed by the Hindu Stokely the Conqueror. With the majority of his populace being Hindu, Geert-Jan is at the knife's edge - will he be able to ensure that Muslim rule in Guyana lasts beyond his life, or is he yet another failed ruler?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1325002;King Zuangua of Michoacán is the grandson of the great King Kuruchi, a humble peasant who was divinely appointed by the goddess Eréndira to strike down the wicked Empire of Mexico. Nearly fifty years later, the empire's remnants are still reeling from its loss. However, Zuangua cannot rest on his laurels. The agents of darkness in Mexico City have begun spreading the idea of a "holy reconquest", and the sons of Kuruchi will surely be one of their first targets. Will Zuangua pick up his grandfather's divine torch, or will darkness consume Mesoamerica once more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1491004;Hastiin Dodge is the current leader of the ancient Navajo people, and things are looking better than ever for them. The Navajo are the undisputed rulers of their homeland, and their co-religionists in the Kingdom of Deseret are valuable allies. However, all is not well in Navajoland. Hastiin is getting old, and his three sons have already begun vying for power in anticipation of his death. Will Navajo remain a Mormon bulwark in Arixo, or will they be divided and weak in the face of the Atomicist heathens to their south?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1788017;The Iroquois are the only native people east of the Mississippi that have retained a foothold in their ancestral lands, and they are led by the young Duke Hiawatha Onondaga of Cayuga. Named for the ancient founder of the Iroquois Confederacy, Hiawatha has already proven himself equal to his namesake in diplomatic skill. However, he is still a vassal to the King of Hudsonia, and the Iroquois people are still a minority in their own lands. Can Hiawatha revive the legacy of the Iroquois, or will he prove unable to match his namesake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1513001;Elias Waltney is the latest ruler of the noble and ancient Tribe of the Mouse. The forefathers of his tribe ruled Orlando in the days before the Event, and it is claimed that they turned this patch of marshland into "the happiest place on Earth." However, Elias faces challenges from both within and without. Elias's days as a charming prince have come and gone, but he still lacks an heir. To make matters worse, both the Holy Columbian Confederacy and the Caribbean Empire eye his lands hungrily. Elias's diplomatic skill can only keep them at bay for so long. Will Elias's story have a happy ending?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1803060;King Louis "the Good" of Louisiana has truly earned his epithet. The Kingdom of Louisiana remains a bastion of the Voodoo faith in an otherwise staunchly Christian region, and it is larger and more prosperous than at any point in its history. However, the city of New Orleans remains out of King Louis's grasp, and the Christians bordering his realm are growing more and more fed up with his continued existence. Can King Louis reclaim his kingdom's rightful capital and ensure its continued prosperity, or will Louisiana finally fall to Christian hands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1910000;King Gaston of Baja is one of the few truly great rulers left in California. Although his personal habits leave something to be desired, nobody can deny that Gaston is one of the strongest and most skilled warriors in all of California. As the Empire of California continues its slow decline, Gaston finds himself in a unique position. Will Gaston be content with his current title, or will he shed his hedonism and use his unique gifts to aim for something... greater?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1845060;Since the collapse of Cascadia, the Kingdom of Lincoln stands as the single strongest Gaian realm in existence. Its ruler, Veronica Lovejoy, has two paths in front of her-- she can exploit the collapse of Cascadia to secure a port on the Pacific and dominance over the lucrative Oregon Trail trade route, or she can stand in solidarity with her Gaian siblings against the threat of Haida Tlagaang. Which path will she choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1650043;Jonathan Sulley is the second king of his name to rule the Kingdom of Moskitia. Both the Kingdom itself and the dynasty that rules it can claim true continuity with their antediluvian counterparts, a unique achievement in the post-Deluge world. However, Moskitia's position is far from secure. They are the last true Christians left in a region that has fallen to heresy and paganism, and the formidable Caribbean Empire eyes the rich lands of the Mosquito coast with envy. Can Jonathan live up to the storied legacy of Moskitia, or will House Sulley finally fall for good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_1845019;The Freeland dynasty has fallen on hard times. Once, it led a united Kingdom of Cascadia and defended the Pacific Northwest from patriarchal northern incursions. Now, however, the once-proud Kingdom of Cascadia has collapsed into a collection of squabbling princesspalities, even as the barbarians gather at the very gates of Cascadia. Kaitlin is one of the most powerful rulers in what was once Cascadia, ruling over the rich trade post of Portland. Will she reunite Cascadia and drive the barbarians back to where they came, or will the rest of Cascadia fall to darkness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###########Religions###########

pirate;Nautical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
candomble;Candomblé;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
candomble_DESC;Candomblé is a syncretic faith that absorbed religious traditions from West Africans, Portuguese Catholics, and indigenous South Americans. Its name literally means "dance in honor of the gods," and, as one would expect, many of its rituals involve music and dance. Practitioners worship a creator deity named Olodumaré, as well as numerous lesser spirits called Orixás. Candomblé practitioners believe that every person has their own patron Orixá, who controls their destiny and acts as a spiritual protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic;Thelema;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion/"spiritual philosophy" developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." It is a polytheistic religion that draws its pantheon of gods from the religious beliefs of Ancient Egypt. However, their highest deity is someone - or something - known only as "The Queen".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
thelemic_FEATURES;§Y*§! Homosexual Thelemic rulers may marry other homosexual characters.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neognostic;Neo-Gnostic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neognostic_DESC;Neo-Gnostism (re)emerged in Colorado as a syncretic faith combining teachings coming from the Pacific faiths of the West and the Christian East. Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God with the rejection of materialism often found in Pacific schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightenment through his teachings. Gnostics see material posessions and desires as secondary to Oneness with God. They reject the material world (matter, flesh) as being the work of Satan and seek to embrace the 'Gnosis' of God (knowledge, enlightenment, salvation).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neognostic_FEATURES;§Y*§! Are considered a Catholic heresy owing to their agreement with the Catholic understanding of God and the Saints, while dismissing the teachings of most Cetic Gurus and Gaian druids.\n§Y*§! May have ambitions to remove vices. \n§Y*§! Homosexual Neognostic rulers are allowed to marry other homosexual characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sedevacantist;Sedevacantist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sedevacantist_DESC;The name Sedevancantist comes from the Latin term 'Sede Vacante', meaning 'the seat is vacant'. Sedevacantism began in the hazy time immediately after the Deluge, when the Pope's Legate unexpectedly arrived at the Council of Chicago. The Legate claimed to have seen a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of Rome. He was then instructed by the Virgin Mary to make his way from Washington to Chicago, where "the remnant of the church" would assemble, and tell those present that they had the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome from among their number. Although the majority of those present thought the apparition to be legitimate, a vocal minority denounced the Legate, denying the truth of the apparition. They broke from the rest of the Council, and their followers continue to insist that the See of Rome is empty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ursuline;Ursuline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ursuline_DESC;The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. Introduced to the Americas during the colonial era, their presence could be found wherever the French colonized. During and shortly after the great cataclysm, Quebecois Roman Catholics, unable to contact old Rome, turned to the Ursuline order for leadership. Since then the Ursulines have served as Quebec's continuation of antediluvian Catholicism, and their followers have steadfastly refused to recognize the American Pope in New Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ursuline_FEATURES;§Y*§! The Abbess-General is elected via the same mechanics as the Pope.\n§Y*§! Women are the only ones who can become priests or cardinals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
angeline;Angeline;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
angeline_DESC;The Angelines also originated as an antediluvian religious order, but they live very different lives from their Ursuline counterparts. Whereas the Ursulines emphasize the monastic lifestyle and the primacy of the Church, Angelines more strongly emphasize cohabitation with the secular world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anabaptist;Anabaptist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anabaptist_DESC;The Anabaptists are a branch of Christianity originating from 16th century Europe, and are the forebears of American groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites, which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world. Anabaptists believe Christians should remain separate from the rest of the world, refuse to hold office, and refrain from violence except when absolutely necessary. These tenets make life after the apocalypse difficult, and often quite short.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anabaptist_FEATURES;§Y*§! Due to their avoidance of violence when possible, cannot use the Holy War CB. \n§Y*§! Anabaptists gain 1.00 piety per month when at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
batenburger;Batenburger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
batenburger_DESC;Batenburgers are a particularly violent group of Christians that emerged following the invasion of Anabaptist lands by Americanists. Followers of Batenburgism believe that the invasion was a sign that the doctrine of pacifism was to be abandoned entirely, rather than being merely relaxed. Followers of other Christian faiths condemn these heretics for their maintenence of harems and their tendency to violently raid the homes of non-believers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
batenburger_FEATURES;§Y*§! Batenburgers are prone to violence, and will go to war frequently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical;Evangelical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical_DESC;The Evangelical Church is what remains of antediluvian Protestantism. In the face of post-deluge upheavals, various Protestant churches banded together, putting aside minor theological differences in favor of establishing an Evangelical Convention of Churches presided over by an ecumenical council of bishops. However, some Christians chafe against the doctrines and restrictions imposed by this Convention...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church;Anglican;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church_DESC;Anglicanism describes itself as being a "via media", or middle way, between Evangelical Protestantism and the Catholic Church. Following the Event, the Anglican Church in Canada refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the Deep South, and it has since become recognized as a separate faith unto itself. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of New Canterbury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
high_church_FEATURES;§Y*§! Although the Archbishop of Canterbury is not elected, rulers can still create competing Archbishops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomian;Antinomian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
antinomian_DESC;"Antinomians" believe that everyone immediately receives eternal life upon accepting Jesus Christ as their savior and that personal revelation is as authoritative as Scripture. Both the mainstream Evangelical Church and virtually every other Protestant denomination regards these doctrines as serious heresies, labeling them "Antinomian" because of their perceived conflict with Biblical and Mosaic law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
postadventist;Postadventist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
postadventist_DESC;Postadventists believe that the Second Coming has already happened, that Jesus came to judge the living and the dead... and was not pleased. They are also notable for observing Saturday rather than Sunday as their day of rest and for their skepticism towards all non-Postadventist temporal authorities. For obvious reasons, mainstream Evangelicals condemn Postadventists as heretics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charismatic;Charismatic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charismatic_DESC;Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief in 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs that can be endowed simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Such wonders include the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered 'supernatural'. Although the Evangelical Convention declared these beliefs heretical, the Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Confederacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
charismatic_FEATURES;§Y*§! Upon reaching adulthood, Charismatic characters may test their faith by handling a live snake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dark_pagan_group;Dark Pagan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist;Occultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist_DESC;Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers. The fragments of ancient lore that survived the Fall have formed the core of a new polytheistic faith quite at odds with most others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist_reformed;Occultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
occultist_reformed_DESC;Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers. The fragments of ancient lore that survived the Fall have formed the core of a new polytheistic faith quite at odds with most others. The reformed Occultist church has a new hierarchy and more standardized set of texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist;Atomicist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist_DESC;Originally a heresy of the ancient Atomic Priesthood, the awe and splendor of many who witnessed the effects of the Atom granted this heresy much more success than its father faith. Although atomic theory is practically forgotten, this wont stop Atomicists from revering old world technology and the invisible world of vast power they tap into. If they could but find a way to tap into this intangible world, they believe they would become gods themselves! The tumors and radiation sickness, though, they don't talk about as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist_FEATURES;§Y*§! Atomicist parents may attempt to "bless" their newborns by exposing them to atomic radiation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aphite;Aphite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aphite_DESC;Originating in the hazy time of the event, Aphites believe and pay reverence to a church known as the Atomic Priesthood. Whilst sharing the Atomicist belief in the invisible world, they believe that it is a wicked thing with which humankind must not meddle, lest the catastrophe which destroyed the Old World be reawoken. Aphites consider it their sacred duty to protect any place or object 'touched by the Atom' from interference by the greedy, ignorant, and heretical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
americanist;Americanist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
americanist_DESC;Americanists worship what must have been the true gods of the old world-- the statues of Father Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and others clearly indicates who the ancient Americans worshiped. Those Americans built a great empire, so why not follow their beliefs and restore America to its former glory, gods and all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
americanist_FEATURES;§Y*§! Are led by the President, who may be elected from any ruler of their faith above the age of 35. \n§Y*§! May undertake pilgrimages to their holy sites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hamiltonian;Hamiltonian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hamiltonian_DESC;Hamiltonians differ from mainstream Americanism in that they take their faith in the gods of the Old World to a higher level. Legends outline the gods' abilities and deeds, but Hamiltonians believe the gods had more powers beyond those explicitly stated. They hold, furthermore, that it is within the capabilities of all believers to attain these 'implied powers' for themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jeffersonian;Jeffersonian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jeffersonian_DESC;The old legends speak not of just Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, but also of the farmers, the soldiers, and all the common men of the Old World. As widespread as the statues of the Founders are, are there not statues of the common infantryman in many old towns? What of the farmers and the grand grange halls they established? Jeffersonians hold that the Americanist gods of the old world were just a few of many, and that the entire nation of ancient America was home to gods. All the land was blessed by the gods, therefore, and thus all the land must be reclaimed by the true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libertarian;Libertarian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libertarian_DESC;The devoted of Lady Liberty, the Mother of Old America and the Goddess of Freedom, the Libertarians were once a matriarchal Patriotic order of the Americanists dedicated to the defense and restoration of the Statues of Liberty who broke from Washington in protest against the 'overemphasis' of the Founders over Lady Liberty. In the centuries since the continued revelation and dedicated study of the First Lady and her Justices have lead the Libertarians and the Americanists to opposite positions on a vast number of theological points, from the approved methods of establishing proof of presidential deification after death all the way to structure of the old world pantheon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
libertarian_FEATURES;§Y*§! There is always a First Lady in Nashville, even if the city falls\n§Y*§! Ability to enact Enatic Succession Laws\n§Y*§! Strict limitations on Consanguinity\n§Y*§! Libertarians follow a principle of non-aggression, so they cannot use the Holy War CB.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rust_cultist;Rust Cultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rust_cultist_DESC;When the first of the Rust Cult stumbled upon an abandoned factory of the old world, what he saw seemed to be the handiwork of the gods. The cult quickly spread through the former Rust Belt, worshiping these houses of the divine and the technological marvels wrought within, which they are willing to defend with their lives. Rust Cultists dedicate much of their time to recovering and revering any old world technology they can find. Due to their age however, opportunities to find operational relics are few and far between.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rust_cultist_FEATURES;§Y*§! May undertake journeys to seek & salvage old world technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chrome_cultist;Chrome Cultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chrome_cultist_DESC;The Chrome Cultists, unlike their Rustish counterparts, believe that mankind once built the great God-Machines worshiped by the mainline Rust Cult. Furthermore, they believe that these men and women of Old America - Father Ford especially - had such power that they could become like those Machines by joining as one with the Engines and other Devices to transcend their fleshy bodies. One day, when mankind has regained this power, all of the Chrome Cult shall become like gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chrome_cultist_FEATURES;§Y*§! May take ambitions to remove irrational impulses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan;Norse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_DESC;The Norse believe the Christian God failed his followers when America was torn down, and in their anger have turned back to the Gods of their ancestors. If only the old Gods had the strength of their faith, they surely would have protected America. They also believe the American people became soft and complacent, which contributed to their destruction, and so have vowed to never allow themselves to become weaklings again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_reformed;Norse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norse_pagan_reformed_DESC;The Norse believe the Christian God failed his followers when America was torn down, and in their anger have turned back to the Gods of their ancestors. If only the old Gods had the strength of their faith, they surely would have protected America. They also believe the American people became soft and complacent, which contributed to their destruction, and so have vowed to never allow themselves to become weaklings again. They have now structured their faith, allowing them full access to mainstream succession laws, as well as the option to wage grand holy wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rastafarian;Rastafari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rastafarian_DESC;Rastafari is a religion originating in Jamaica, inspired by both the Christian Bible and the teachings of Marcus Garvey. They believe that a pre-Event emperor from "Zion" known as Ras Tafari was the representative of Jah, or God, on Earth, and that "the Event" was the result of Jah overthrowing the wicked forces of "Babylon", allowing the world to start anew. The Rasta faith is divided into several groups, or "mansions", and the two largest Rasta Mansions in the post-apocalyptic world are Bobo Ashanti and the Twelve Tribes of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rastafarian_FEATURES;§Y*§! May go on vision quests with the aid of sacramental herbs.\n§Y*§! May join Bobo Ashanti or the Twelve Tribes of Israel via targeted decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
voodoo;Voodoo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
voodoo_DESC;Descended from West African Vodun, Voodoo originated in 18th century Haiti, spreading later to Louisiana. Vodouists worship the creator god Bondye, but as he is unreachable by men, they pray to his servants, the Loa, who act as intermediaries in exchange for service. Each Loa is responsible for a different aspect of life, and vodouists develop a personal relationship with them through elaborate ceremonies that can include ritual offerings, song, dance, and allowing themselves to be possessed by the spirits so that Loa and vodouist may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
voodoo_FEATURES;§Y*§! May go on vision quests with the aid of sacramental herbs.\n§Y*§! May crush the mind of a prisoner with poison, turning them into a zombi.\n§Y*§! Possession by the Loa may grant various advantages and disadvantages. \n§Y*§! Homosexual Voodoo rulers are allowed to marry other homosexual characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
african_group;African;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
afro_syncretic;Afro-Syncretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic_DESC;Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and it survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America recieved word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome from their number. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Catholic Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santeria;Santería;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santeria_DESC;Santería, translating roughly to "devotion to the saints", is an Afro-Cuban religion that can be traced back to the Yoruba people of West Africa. Believers worship three aspects of one god: Olodumaré the Creator, Olorun, who manifests as the Sun, and Olofi, who directly communicates with the Orichás - or "Saints" - and grants them spiritual energy to act as intermediaries between man and God, as well as to help mankind live moral, harmonious lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santeria_FEATURES;§Y*§! May go on vision quests with the aid of sacramental herbs. \n§Y*§! Homosexual Santería rulers are allowed to marry other homosexual characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

consumerist;Consumerist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
consumerist_DESC;Consumerists believe that the Almighty Dollar struck down Old America because they did not honor it enough using the ritual of "shopping". They seek to forestall a second apocalypse by "spending" as much as possible, in order to ensure that the Dollar's power is maintained at a consistent level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monetarist;Monetarist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monetarist_DESC;Monetarists differ from Consumerists in that they believe that overzealous "shopping" actually weakens the Almighty Dollar, and that one should instead seek to "save" its power by collecting holy artifacts such as dollar bills and bonds. This position is condemned by mainstream Consumerists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revelationist;Revelationist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revelationist_DESC;A syncretic belief system, Revelationism's origins are Christian in nature. The trauma of the apocalypse and centuries of isolation and turmoil have lead to great distortions in the faith, emphasizing the supernatural and miraculous while often forgetting the Holy Trinity altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
revelationist_FEATURES;§Y*§! Upon reaching adulthood, Charismatic characters may test their faith by handling a live snake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

trailwalker;Trailwalker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
trailwalker_DESC;Trailwalker is a religion invested in the borderland, the crossings between flesh, soul, and dream. Trailwalkers believe in an omnipresent spiritual plane called the Frontier, ruled by a pantheon headed by the Almighty Spirit of the West. In the beginning, there was only the Frontier, and men lived short and harsh lives. However, the Almighty Spirit took pity on humanity and, with the help of his otherworldly servants, cleaved the Range from the Frontier. The Range was the new home of humanity, where men could live free lives. However, in exchange for this gift, the Almighty Spirit asked humanity to follow the Trails, the righteous paths through life. Mankind at first heeded his words, but eventually turned away from the Trails and took the Range for granted. In anger, the Almighty Spirit briefly reunited the Frontier and the Range, destroying mankind's works. Mankind should never again stray from the Trails...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
trailwalker_FEATURES;§Y*§! In ancient times, the Almighty created the two greatest paths for his people to walk alongside: The Cattle Way and the Maize Way.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sacred_heart_DESC;The followers of Sagrado Corazón- the Sacred Heart- follow both the Holy Trinity and a pantheon of quasi-deities derived from Catholic traditions, who are ultimately subservient to God but powerful in their own right. Although the faith has Catholic origins and its followers regard themselves as Christian, it has deviated far from the old theology, and the Catholic Church north of the Rio Grande regards Sagrado Corazón as heretical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mictlantec_DESC;Mictlantec is a revival of old Aztec traditions for the new Age of the Dead Sun. The previous cycle ended in apocalypse with the near destruction of the sun god Huitzilopochtli in his struggle against the darkness. Death god Mictlantecuhtli was largely responsible for saving humanity, and is now considered the sun god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

sol_invicta;Jurihiata Ikikunari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sol_invicta_DESC;Jurihiata Ikikunari is a religion based on Mesoamerican mythology that emerged after the Event. Followers of Jurihiata Ikikunari revere Eréndira, the sun goddess. When the forces of darkness came to enslave Mexico, Eréndira, then a mortal princess, fought valiantly against them by teaching her people the ways of the horse. Although she failed to stop the conquest of darkness, she ascended to Aúandarhu, the land of the gods, instead of dying. Over time, the gods in Aúandarhu began to vanish because of the influence of the darkness on their people. The last god to vanish, the sun god, passed his mantle to Eréndira. The new sun goddess then used her divine power to free Mexico by wiping the world's slate clean. The darkness still fights to regain its power, but Eréndira will always protect her faithful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neomayan;Neomayan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
neomayan_DESC;Neomayanism is a mixture of both Mayan beliefs and obscure Old World spirituality. According to their own history, the original Mayan civilization was not completely destroyed. It instead moved on to a new reality as a result of their collective worship of all things and the grace of Hunab Ku, the One True God. Neomayans believe that they currently live in the Age of Aquarius, and that the beginning of this age was ushered in by a period where the Earth was consumed in Darkness. The Darkness destroyed the corrupt world order that preceded the Age of Aquarius, but it also allowed many unnatural creatures and negative energies to enter the natural world. In order to protect oneself from these dangers, one must devote themselves totally to Hunab Ku.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

uahomche;Uahomche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
uahomche_DESC;Uahomche blends aspects of both Christianity and the traditional Mayan faith. Adherents believe that the Event was the end of the 5th world cycle, which was caused by both a lack of sacrifices and the conversion of Mayan believers to monotheism. Gods in the Uahomche pantheon are referred to as angels, but most of these angels are simply pre-Christian Maya deities under a different name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

celtic_pagan_DESC;Followers of Druidism believe in a diverse and eclectic pantheon of gods, drawn from both classical paganism and native beliefs. The core tenet of Druidism is animism - the belief that all of nature is inhabited by divine spirits. Although Druidism was once commonly practiced throughout the North Atlantic, it has been mostly supplanted by other religions and is today only practiced on the fringes of its old territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

thelemic_reformed_DESC;Thelema is a British mystic religion/"spiritual philosophy" developed by Aleister Crowley, based on the law: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." It is a polytheistic religion that draws its pantheon of gods from the religious beliefs of Ancient Egypt. However, their highest deity is someone - or something - known only as "The Queen". Thelemites in the United States have rediscovered the writings of Aleister Crowley in the Crimson Library, and have used these works to codify their beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gracia_divina_DESC;The adherents of Gracia Divina hold belief in the karma-like system of 'divine grace'. They believe that the greater piety and devoutness shown in life, the more fortunate their lives will become, that they literally become graced by the divine. They believe especially that devotion to specific saints will lead to that saint becoming their patron, and directly influence their lives. This can lead to very zealous devotion as the worshipper takes on an extremely personal and intimate connection with their patron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
espiritista;Tres Potencias;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
espiritista_DESC;Tres Potencias, or "Three Powers", is a syncretic religion native to Venezuela. Followers of Tres Potencias believe that good and evil spirits inhabit our world, with the powers to affect health, luck, and other aspects of human life. There is a Supreme God, but under him are the "Three Powers" for which the religion is named. They are mortals who have ascended to the level of deities: María Lionza, Negro Felipe, and Guaicaipuro. Beneath the Three Powers are the spirits, powerful mortals who continue to influence the world long after their deaths. These spirits are organized into 21 "courts", and believers can petition these courts for aid through prayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

falling_star;Falling Star;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
falling_star_DESC;Sometime either during or just after the Apocalypse, the Church of the Falling Star believes a star fell from the heavens and onto Earth. This star was a fallen Angel who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. Practitioners of the Falling Star faith are generally viewed with suspicion by those with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels is generally thought of as evil and associated with Satan. However, the Falling Star faithful insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, members of the Fallen Star still fall under the Christian banner, albeit with a theology that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

In some tales Raven is playful and benevolent, while in others he is greedy, treacherous, and wanton. He is sometimes loved and sometimes feared. Raven indirectly made the world by stealing and transforming that which came before, and preserved the Haida though the Dark Times with cleverness and trickery.

mormon_DESC;With roots in Ancient America's frontier, Mormonism has a solid hold on many parts of the Old West. Although based on Christian foundations, the Church of Latter-Day Saints has many additional books, customs, and traditions which have caused it to be treated differently from some elements of mainstream Christianity. With the chaos of the apocalypse, these attitudes were exacerbated, and Mormonism is widely treated as a wholly distinct entity from the Catholicism of New Rome and the Protestantism of the East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The Bickertonites believe that they have a sacred duty to share the gift of salvation with people of every race, and allow women to be ordained into the priesthood, unlike other LDS sects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woolleyite;Woolleyite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
woolleyite_DESC;The Woolleyites split from mainstream Mormonism in the early 20th century after polygamy was officially banned by the Church. Led by Lorin Woolley, the "Woolleyites", as they are known after the Event, stubbornly continue to practice polygamy to this day. Mainstream Mormonism considers plural marriages to be heretical, and will excommunicate anyone who is found to be part of one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strangite;Strangite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
strangite_DESC;The Strangites believe James Strang to be the lawful successor of Joseph Smith, and consider the historical leaders of the Mormon church to be heretics. Strangites allow the ordination of women into the priesthood and reject the notion of the trinity (believing that there is only one God, and that Jesus was born an ordinary mortal). Animal sacrifice is common, and devout farmers make an offering of the "Firstfruit" of the harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

brethren;Brethren;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brethren_DESC;With a strong tradition of seafaring and a reputation for robbery and murder, most call the Brethren pirates. This assessment is not far from the truth. Though the Brethren follow a Code of the Sea, they are loosely organized and live mostly to plunder riches from the weak. All of their gods have some link to the ocean, which they consider the source of all life and all wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

gaian;Gaian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaian_DESC;Gaians worship numerous spirits of nature, Gaia foremost among them. Also known as Earth Mother, the Goddess, or Primordia, the faithful believe Gaia is a divine spirit interconnected with all living things... the ancient soul of the Earth itself. Gaian theology encourages a society ruled by women rather than men, teaching that man neglected the world and that it was his disregard for the natural balance that led the Earth to ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaian_FEATURES;§Y*§! Gaians have access to Enatic, or female-preference, succession. \n§Y*§! Gaians gain 2.00 purity per month when at peace. \n§Y*§! Homosexual Gaian rulers may marry other homosexual characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

cetic_DESC;The Cetic faith involves the study of philosophical writings by a number of Great Teachers (Gurus), including the Emperor, Buddha, Christ, and Hubbard. Adherents seek enlightenment through meditation and discussion of the writings. The first Emperor of California formally organized the faith with secular and religious power deeply intertwined within the imperial title, and the head of the faith is traditionally chosen from among his descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cetic_FEATURES;§Y*§! Adherents follow one of five specific Ways (schools of Cetic thought). \n§Y*§! Strong Cetic Emperors may incorporate Gaianism into the Way of the Branch if they control the Kingdom of Cascadia.\n§Y*§! Homosexual Way of the Branch Adherents may take other homosexual characters as marriage partners. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shinto;Shinto;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
shinto_DESC;Shinto is an ancient religion that combines cultural rituals, animist spirit worship, and a limited number of Buddhist traditions. In the centuries after the calamity, veneration of the Emperor grew into a demand for absolute obedience. Today the Divine Emperor is hidden from the people and believed to be in a perfect, eternal state of meditation, while his will is carried out by a sprawling clerical bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jewish;Orthodox;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewish_DESC;Judaism is one of the oldest religions on the planet, and it survived the Event like it did so many other catastrophes. Although Orthodox Judaism's practices have changed relatively little over the last few centuries, the Jews of post-Event America now face discrimination and persecution on a scale unheard of since the Middle Ages of old. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Orthodox Jews still patiently await the arrival of the Moshiach, who will, in due time, gather the Jews living in exile and return them to the land promised to their forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform;Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
reform_DESC;Reform Judaism first emerged before the Event, and its ideals have managed to persist among Jewish communities throughout the centuries. Reform Jews regard Halacha (Jewish religious law) as non-binding, permit women to be ordained as rabbis, and do not believe in the imminent arrival of a Messiah. Reform Jews instead maintain that individual Jews should work towards restoring the pre-Event world through good works and philanthropy. This principle is known as "Tikkun Olam"-- literally, "repair of the world".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

meshichist;Meshichist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
meshichist_DESC;Meshichists believe that a legendary pre-Event rabbi, known to them as simply "the Rebbe", was the Moshiach - the Jewish Messiah. Mainstream Jews reject this view, pointing out that the Rebbe has been dead for centuries - a condition that would normally disqualify him from being the Moshiach. Nevertheless, Meshichists remain steadfast in their belief that the Rebbe was-- and is-- the Moshiach, believing that he is still alive in a metaphorical sense. Meshichists frequently recite the Yechi, an affirmation of their belief in a living "King Messiah", at prayer services and during holidays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nonconformist;Nonconformist;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nonconformist_DESC;The term "nonconformist" is used by antediluvian Anglicans to refer to all non-Ursuline Canadian Christians who, for one reason or another, reject the authority of the Anglican Church. Many different Protestant groups have been persecuted using this label over the centuries, and present-day Noncomformists are primarily known for their acceptance of female clergy and opposition to the idea of religious hierarchy in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

indian_group;Dharmic;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hindu_DESC;Hinduism is not a single religion so much as a blanket term for the successor faiths of ancient Indian polytheism as recorded in the Vedas. Post-Event Hinduism differs radically from pre-Event Hinduism in several key ways. For example, the vast majority of Hindus now reject the caste system, believing instead that all humans are spiritually equal. Proselytization towards non-Hindus has also become more common.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hindu_FEATURES;§Y*§! Hindus can select one of six deities to be their patron.\n§Y*§! Hindus can go on pilgrimages to holy sites across the Americas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nousthreskeia;Nousthreskeia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nousthreskeia_DESC;The central tenet of Nousthreskeia is the concept of the Noosphere, an invisible field that surrounds the Earth and is affected by the collective thoughts and feelings of humanity. Followers of Nousthreskeia believe that the Noosphere is capable of altering both the collective human consciousness and physical reality itself, and that the Event was the result of artificial interference with the Noosphere. This interference damaged the Noosphere, knocking the physical world and the consciousness of humanity back to a more primitive state. Nousthrestkeists believe that humanity will not recover from the Event until this damage to the Noosphere has been healed and that a Wish Granter exists somewhere in the world that can accomplish this goal almost instantaneously if used properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pagan_DESC;Since the dawn of history, both North and South America have been home to countless Pagan religions and cults unrelated to the Abrahamic faiths.;Depuis l'aube de l'Histoire, tant l'Europe que le Moyen-orient on été le foyer d'innombrables religions païennes et cultes détachés des fois abrahamiques.;Seit dem Beginn der Geschichte waren sowohl Europa als auch der Nahe Osten Heimat unzähliger heidnischer Religionen und Kulte, die nicht zum abrahamitischen Glauben zählten.;;Desde el comienzo de los tiempos, tanto Europa como Oriente Medio han sido el hogar de incontables religiones paganas y de cultos no relacionados con las religiones abrahámicas.;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;Nestorians are an ancient branch of Christianity deemed heretical for their belief in the dual nature (human and divine) of Christ. The Nestorian position was historically adopted by the Church of the East, offshoots of which have periodically drifted into and out of communion with the Pope. Some of these offshoots relocated to the United States during the 20th century, and fell out of communion with the St. Louis Papacy after the Event, instead turning to the Patriarch of the East to lead their faith. Because of this, Nestorians are now considered by most to be a Catholic heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic_DESC;The "Igreja Apostólica", or "Apostolic Church", split from mainstream Roman Catholicism long before the Event over disputes regarding divorce and clerical celibacy. It eventually became known for its relative tolerance of non-Christian faiths. After the chaos of the Event, the Apostolic Church became the dominant Christian faith in most of Brazil, and this position was cemented further when it was adopted by the first post-Event Emperor of the House of Bragança, Pedro the Restorer. All adherents north of the Amazon river are led by the Archbishop of Manaus, although he is only a subordinate of the Church's true leader in São Paulo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

moravian_DESC;Moravianism is one of the oldest branches of Protestant Christianity, and followers of the Church are noted for their intense dedication to missionary work.

Peyotists believe that a single divine being known as the Great Spirit personally guides the fates of everything and everyone in Creation. Peyotists believe that one can directly communicate with and recieve blessings from the Great Spirit through the use of peyote, or "the holy sacrament", during special ceremonies held at specific times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

exovedate_DESC;The Exovedate faith is a syncretic mix between Catholicism, Judaism, and First Nations beliefs, based on the teachings of the martyr Louis Riel. Its adherents believe that Riel was a messianic figure and prophet, who helped bring about the Event so that his followers could  lead the world into a new era of greatness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodox;Kanéist Átk'aheen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodox_DESC;The religion of the Tlingit is said to have been brought to them long before the Event by bearded strangers from across the sea. Although Kanéist Átk'aheen has Christian origins, it has become heavily distorted due to its isolation from the rest of the Christian world, incorporating native Tlingit practices and idiosyncratic beliefs. Despite all this, however, the "Cross Faith" has managed to survive the rise of the Haida in the Northwest, and has even managed to attract many non-Tlingit followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelagic;Pelagic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pelagic_DESC;Followers of the Pelagic faith roam the seven seas, much like their Brethren cousins. However, that is where their similarities end. Rather than live through piracy and murder, Pelagics instead draw on the natural gifts of the sea. In particular, Pelagics regard whales as the most powerful of all seaborne beings, capable of both giving and taking life at a moment's notice. Pelagics work to gain the favor of the sea goddess, Sedna, creator of the sea and mother of all its creatures, so that she may give them her gifts via her first and greatest child- the whale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
