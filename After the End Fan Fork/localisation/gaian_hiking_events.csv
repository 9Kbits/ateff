EVTITLE_garibaldi_ending;Reaching Garibaldi's Summit ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_garibaldi_ending; You can almost feel the magma churning below your feet as you and your entourage make your ways up, tied together to avoid falling off the ridge, ice axe in hand as you advance towards the summit of Mt. Garibaldi. It has been a tough climb, something rarely accomplished by modern humanity, hands cut by the ropes and feet aching. Here you are, ankle deep in snow as you stand on what must be the top of the world, sweating despite the frigid air. It is said that Garibaldi once walked this earth as a man, a fighter, a warrior who slew tyrants in a far off land before returning. He was infuriated when he saw his home submitted to Despotism and the Sickness of Man, and such was his fury that a mountain burst open, scattering liquid flame across it. Now Garibaldi wages his endless revolution. You hope your journey has pleased Him as you rest, looking out to the sun. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_greatbear_ending;Looking at Great Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_greatbear_ending; It has been a difficult trek, but you've found it. The sacred spirit of this woodland has revealed itself to you. You gaze at the snow white Spirit for a moment, admiring it's fur and ethereal beauty as the beast drinks from the pool of crystal clear water. You move not a muscle as the bear slowly turns and walks away from the water, panting as it sits to relax. And then you see two more! Cubs, one black, one white, come running out from behind a tree, chasing one another and playing. Truly a magical moment, this is. Legend says the Great Bear Rainforest once covered all the northwest, and the people in those days were cruel to nature and tore it down piece by piece, taking the pelts of sacred spirit bears as trophies of sport. The Spirit of the Forest, the eponymous Great Bear was enraged by this, and her wrath turned many forests to ash as a punishment for the acts of mankind. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_carmanah_ending;After many days of travel, you have reached the end of the path. You stand at the base of the largest tree in the province, a worn and aged sign before you indicating its height. This is the Carmanah Giant, the behemoth of the island. Fruits, meats, and carved totems are scattered around its roots in sacrifice to the spirit that dwells within, surely the most ancient of these august woodlands. In the days before the event, these woodlands were threatened by metal monsters, tools of mankind that cut the trees down, angering the spirits and the people in kind. The common Canuck, the Nuu-chah-nulth, even the far flung Mennonites called for this destruction to cease. Even when the ruler of this land decreed the woods protected, people disobeyed. Thus is the folly of greed... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_sooke_ending;At the depths of Sooke ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_sooke_ending;You've followed the trail through these woodlands and arrived at the other side, the ancient Cabin standing on the edge of the Pacific, the edge of the world. You enter it, muttering a prayer to the spi that dwells within, the spirit of the whole forest, as you sit at it's table and relax. You then leave the house, walking to the fire pit and lighting a fire to make a sacrifice to the spirit. You burn food and a wooden carving, putting the flame out with water drawn from the Ocean. Long ago, these woodlands were the home of John Muir of the Mountains, a folk hero to all Gaians from Prince George to the Sierra Nevadas. Muir was a well-respected sage, and a proud defender of Gaia in an age otherwise dominated by villains of all characters. His wife loved the woodlands of Sooke, so Muir settled there once all his great deeds were done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_bowen_ending;Overlooking the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_bowen_ending;You have reached Bowen lookout, the end of your journey, and it has been a long one indeed. While you sit upon the edge of the cliff, gazing out upon the land you just passed by, you think upon your home in this spot, covered in snow. In days long ago, a competition was held here, a part of the Olympics that all Gaians would partake in. People came from all over to this holy mounty, skis strapped to their feet, for this mountain was well known for grounds suited perfectly to skiing. Amongst all these rich and mighty athletes, one person stuck out, dressed in rags. They said they wanted to participate, with tattered skis tied to their bare feet. When the competition began, this beggar managed to trounce all the athletes who had trained for this for years. This was no beggar, rather the spirit of the mountain. The spirit jeered at the athletes as they arrived at the bottom, and when they reacted in anger the spirit revealed their true form, humbling these great men and sending them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_fraser_ending;The Walk through Fraser;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_fraser_ending;As you walk along the Shore of the fair-flowing Fraser, you spy the crumbling and rusted ruin of a bridge, spanning the mighty river, wrapped in vines. You see not a man crossing it, nor shall you likely ever, and you contemplate this. All man has constructed has eventually been destroyed, all your works worn eventually to dust against nature. But this does not mean Man is doomed to futility, for only men can better the world in a demonstrable way. Many many years ago, before BC was even a land, before the Royal City or Gastown were founded, men came to this place for one thing. Gold. The spirit of the River was glad to let them take the gold, as it was a generous spirit, but then man built cities upon him. Dumped waste into him. So he stopped providing the people with gold. To this day, any gold found within those waters is negligent, if it exists at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_harrison_ending;The Waters at Transformer Point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_harrison_ending;Your Canoe creaks and groans as you guide it along the shoreline of Lake Harrison, eyes scanning the shoreline for the marker that guides Hikers to their destination. Then you spot it - a silver cloth banner fluttering in the wind, just 'round the corner. You speed your rowing, rounding the bend and leaping out of your canoe, rushing to the shoreline. There, you spot it. The Man Turned to Stone. \n Long ago, when magicians and shapeshifters were commonplace, two of them met. The first was a Doctor, the second a servant of Gaia. The Doctor doubted this claim, and challenged the second to a transformation contest. The Doctor and the Servant struggled against each other for a long time, but the Doctor could not win, being turned to stone by the Servant. His people are currently wrapping a blanket around you, welcoming you to their village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_canfield_ending;At the end of your hike you find yourself at the summit of Mount Canfield, and you find yourself standing alongside the steel scrap of a pre-event piece of infrastructure, you look about the surroundings and see the outskirts of the village of Spokane Valley, in what Pre-Event Americans called "Washington". As you crane your head downwards you can see the holding of Coeur D'alene, once a major city in pre-event times, now a humble village hugging the great lake that shares it's name. From here you can see the vague outlines of where the ancient city had been, aided by sporadic maintaince of it's roads as they turned from ancient asphalt, to paved stone, and finally dirt over the centuries. From this vantage point, you find yourself with a finer understanding of the scale of mankind's villages and hamlets within Gaia's Domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hells_canyon_ending;After the harrowing expedition up the winding Snake River and through the deepest canyon in North America, you realize the hills and mountains on your peripheral vision are shrinking away as you leave the canyon and enter the plains. When eventually you see the riverside farms of Boise, your suspicions that you are at the journey's end are confirmed. As you make camp for the night before your return home in the morning, you reflect on the experience, recalling the stories of the Nez Perce who had lived in the canyon, and crossed it in their historic fight with the Ancient Americans of old. You think more on your own experiences traveling and traversing the difficult terrain, and you wonder how the Nez Perce had successfully brought hundreds of horses and their women and children across. At the end of your nights reflection, you think you better understand how you would command large movements of men and horses across such terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_pend_orielle_ending;The Pend Orielle Navigated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_pend_orielle_ending;Your journey finds you at a rocky shore of the Lake Pend Orielle. Finally at the edge of the mighty lake, you partake in stone skipping across it's dark blue waters. You recall a story told to you by the locals, who call the lake "Ponderay", of the legendary cutthroat trout named "Virginia". The myths say this trout was over 15 men long, made of solid steel, and despite being sightless, navigated around the lake using sound alone. Some of them say this wicked troat was created by the Americans of old as a weapon of war, but these claims are far fetched. You watch the ripples of the water underneath your stones merge into the calm movements of the lake, pondering the nature of this lake and the demon fish that haunts it, wondering what the odds are of your sinking stone hitting Virginia's Side, your odds of even slightly inconveniencing such a creature. You conclude your thoughts, glad that man is no longer capable of distorting Gaia's creatures in such an unnatural way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_hiawatha_ending;Your feet ache somewhat as you exit the final tunnel on the trail, and you find a boulder to rest on and reflect. The tunnels themselves had been built centuries ago, the Trailwalkers would say by Iron Horse or his followers, but fellow Gaians claim druids had built them to connect the isolated mountain tribesmen with the villages of the Silver Valley, permitted by Gaia through extensive rituals and offerings left for her for the right to impose their will upon nature. You retie the straps to your boots, remembering the many faces of the locals you passed in the tunnels and up the trail, and even now as an old man and his wife lead their mule loaded with goods to sell at market into the darkness of the tunnel, you better understand the blessings of Gaia's benevolence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_trail_courdalenes_ending;Your great journey has ended, and you have found yourself at the a village called Mullan, nestled deep into the Silver Valley, and as nightfall approaches, you make camp at it's outskirts. The aching feet of many of your party members leads them to an early rest, however you and another courtier stay up and share thoughts on the trip by the fire. The night drags on, and as you both decide to call it and rest, you hear a noise from the darkness ahead. Out comes a mighty Elk, the largest you have ever seen or even heard of. The elk comes forward to your fire, showing no signs of discomfort at your presence, looks the two of you in the eye, and calmly retreats back into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_celilo_falls_ending;After a long journey through twisting rapids, you pull your canoe to the river banks. you have arrived at what must be the mightiest waterfall you've seen, a grand cascading wall of water stretching for leagues. Celilo, Wyam, The Chutes: these falls have held many names over the years, but always held an important place in the hearts of all who lived along the banks of Mother Columbia or her children. The wicked men before the deluge trapped these waters behind walls of stone, but Gaia swept their walls away as she does all the schemes of men. Along the edges of the falls you see scattered fishing platforms and a great mass of market stalls on the shoreline, all celebrating the bounty of the great salmon harvest. You arrive to the marketplace, famished from a long day's journey';;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_spokane_ending;As you continue your march uphill, you realize you have reached the end of the treeline, as the ponderosa pines appear now only in small and tight clusters. A few hundred yards further up the bald mountainside and you find yourself at it's summit. A variety of fellow Gaians have gathered around it's peak, resting after their own hikes, centered around a mighty stone. Erected by a druid in post-event times and covered top to bottom in elaborate carvings and designs of Gaia and her creations, with a name carved in dozens of tongues on it's front. It's name is that of the Mountain and the people it is named after, who call themselves in their own tongue the Children of the Sun. As you stand there in the sunlight on the bald mountaintop, the warmth of Gaia's radiance overwhelms you with awe at her glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Parched from such a long hike, you walk over to a large pool of water filled with snowmelt known to locals as Teardrop Pool, you kneel down and take a drink from the clear ice cold water.

EVTOPTA_hike_hot_river;A quick dip won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_hike_hot_river;It is far too dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_ate_my_soup;Ate my soup;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_hike_mushroomstew; While foraging for food, one of the members of your entourage found some really pretty mushrooms and without thinking, put it on the souper, now as the leader of the group you decide whether to eat it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_hike_mushroomstew; I bet its delicious! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_hike_mushroomstew; I think we should skip it tonight... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_hike_mushroomstew; May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] damn you Mushroom Soup! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_rock_skipping;As the travel continues you all see a small tributary river, along it a very nice collection of perfectly round pebles, the best opportunity for some good rock throwing, you take a step forward and weigh the rock in your hand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_rock_skipping2; As you throw it the rock travels with great speed, bouncing off the surface of the small river, once, twice, ten times, the rock was thrown with such excellence it gets to the other side of the river, most people are rightfully impressed, while in your face sits a good smirk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_rock_skipping3;As you throw it the rock travels with great speed, bouncing off the surface of the small river, once, twice, before stopping and going under, most courtiers are quite happy at trying their own throws aswell, while in your face sits a smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_rock_skipping4;As you throw it the rock travels with great speed, hitting the water and quickly disappearing beneath the river, most courtiers look to the other side with cringe, while in your face sits your palm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_rock_skipping;I will try my chances...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_rock_skipping;Thats how I do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_rock_skipping;Good enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_rock_skipping;I am at a loss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_rock_skipping;Maybe next time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_getting_lost;The trail doesnt seem to be going anywhere, and you are pretty sure you saw that particular tree a few hours ago... aparently you have found yourself lost in the trail... there has be a way out...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_getting_lost;Hasnt there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_lost_fixing1;After many days of being lost, in the distance, in your horizon, you spot a column of smoke emanating from the middle of the forest, could this be a way out of this situation and back into the trail?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_lost_fixing1;We should head towards it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_lost_fixing1;It might be a forest fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_lost_fixing2;As you go walking for a few more days you recognize that this area looks near to a place busy with many travellers, it would be a good choice now to do something about that and try and attract attention so you can leave this nightmare of being lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_lost_fixing2;I do have a nice clay whistle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_lost_fixing2;Let us shout really loudly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_lost_fixing2;We should just go towards them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
