rainier_topping;Saw the world from Rainier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_mt_rainier_ending;Atop the Cascades ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_mt_rainier_ending; The air is thin and the wind whips your face as you and your company stand on the summit of Mount Rainier, the highest peak of the Cascade Mountains. Home to one of the most regal spirits, Rainier has become a beacon to Gaians who wish to show their strength and prove themselves to the spirit of this mountain. You have braved frostbite, powerful winds, and icy slopes to stand here, a feat very few accomplish. Truly you have proven yourself worthy to Rainier’s spirit, as you prepare to descend back down the mountain a figure appears in the corner of your vision and gives an approving nod before disappearing. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mt_saint_helens_ending; They say the spirit of Mount Saint Helens is a vengeful spirit, always consumed by rage. Throughout history this mountain has erupted many times, and every time it has wrought destruction and pain to those who choose to live in the mountain’s shadow. Even now as you walk along the rim of the crater atop the mountain, you can see that the spirit of this mountain still stirs. Smoke seeps out from cracks within the crater, and at times it feels like the whole mountain shakes with rage. You kneel atop the mountain and ask the spirit for guidance. Your vision is suddenly filled with visions of unimaginable destruction, a taste of the spirit’s power. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_mount_hood_ending; As the sun begins to set, you and your entourage finally pass the Pearly Gates and reach the summit of Mount Hood. From the summit of this mighty mountain you can see for miles in every direction. As you take in the beauty and majesty of the world around you, you reflect on your journey up the mountain. You’ve braved many trials created by the spirits to reach the summit, harsh winds, deep snow, treacherous glaciers, and steep slopes. Even in pre-event times few could manage such a feat, yet here you are standing on one of the highest peaks of the Cascade Mountains. This journey has left you feeling stronger than ever. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_gaian_csc_mountain; I will journey to the Three Sisters, but I am only climbing one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_gaian_csc_river;You have decided to go on a hike on a trail towards a body of water. On the seaward Cascades these are plentiful, and the spirits thrive and are joyful, so choosing one can be a hard... but all life comes with choice... and you must choose now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_crater_lake_ending;Where the Spirits Meet ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_crater_lake_ending; You stand on the cliff surrounding Crater Lake, next to you a local druid recounts the story of the two spirits of Crater Lake. How long ago the mountain spirit of this place nearly perished in a great calamity, but was saved by a water spirit. When the calamity ended the mountain spirit’s mountain was a smoldering crater, save for a small outcrop inside the crater. Out of gratitude the mountain spirit offered the water spirit to live in the crater as it would be perfect for a lake, while the mountain spirit would live in what remained of their home. Ever since that day the two spirits have had a close bond and remain inseparable. Perhaps there is a moral to be taken from this tale of kindness. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_redwoods_ending;Regrowth Among The Ruin ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_redwoods_ending; Of the events of the Green Sash Rebellion, few were as important as the Burning of The Redwoods. The fateful day when James Gearheart, the bloodthirsty Prefect of The Redwoods set the forest alight and unleashed his thugs upon the thousands of Gaian pilgrims fleeing the inferno. Even now as you walk among the rotting stumps and fallen trees you can still find the bones of those who perished that fateful day. But even among all this death and destruction life goes on, and the spirits toil away to repair the land. Songbirds can once again be heard singing in the regrowth, deer browse on low lying shrubs, and even now new Redwoods sprout from the soil. Given enough time, the great Redwood Forest of old will return. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_gaian_csc_forest; Maybe I should go to Forest Park.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_forest_park_ending;A Friend in The Forest ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTDESC_forest_park_ending; After hours of wandering around the trails of Forest Park, you decide to take a small break on a nearby bench. While sitting down you hear the sound of someone approaching from down the trail, from around a bend in the trail comes a figure wearing a large cloak. The cloaked stranger sits next to you on the bench and quickly sparks a conversation with you, the next thing you know you’re chatting like good friends. Eventually the stranger excuses themself and continues up the trail, as they disappear around a bend in the trail you notice something odd. The stranger never left any footprints as they walked. Were they the spirit of this forest?  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_gaian_cnk_mountain;You have decided to go on an expedition up to the proud mountains, to see all the land through their thin air.

These hills have been inhabited for millennium by groups such as the Nez Perce, the Spokane, and the Coeur D'alene, however the Americans who came later are responsible for the phenomena you would see from here if you were to camp longer. When they came they brought with them wheat, and they began a still running tradition by covering the landscape in it's seeds, before waiting for harvest. Even now you see the tiny silhouettes of dozens of men and women hard at work, carving at away at the gold color that covers the hills. You think you could sit here for hours watching, but eventually, it's time to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_st_joe_ending;Up the Shadowy Saint Joe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_st_joe_ending;You find yourself miles and miles up the long and winding St. Joe river, eventually reaching Old Avery. The town was built in Ancient times, but flooding and erosian led to it's abandonment centuries ago. For now however, a small waystation is maintained by druids of various origins, and you stop and rest. Many in your party call it a day, and borrow fishing rods from the waystation and huddle by the shore, casting their lines into the water. You grab a pole of your own and find a spot away from the rest of the fishermen, casting the line back and forth into the river. You have little luck until suddenly, the rod jerks so hard it nearly flies out of your hands. You pull the rod backwards, and spend what seems like hours in a duel with this fish, before finally, you have a massive bulltrout on the shore. Your court surrounds you and showers you with respect, as you decide to....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_garibaldi_ending;Reaching Garibaldi's Summit ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_garibaldi_ending; You can almost feel the magma churning below your feet as you and your entourage make your ways up, tied together to avoid falling off the ridge, ice axe in hand as you advance towards the summit of Mt. Garibaldi. It has been a tough climb, something rarely accomplished by modern humanity, hands cut by the ropes and feet aching. Here you are, ankle deep in snow as you stand on what must be the top of the world, sweating despite the frigid air. It is said that Garibaldi once walked this earth as a man, a fighter, a warrior who slew tyrants in a far off land before returning. He was infuriated when he saw his home submitted to Despotism and the Sickness of Man, and such was his fury that a mountain burst open, scattering liquid flame across it. Now Garibaldi wages his endless revolution. You hope your journey has pleased Him as you rest, looking out to the sun. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_van_lions_ending;You clamber up the rocks, following the markings left by those who came before as you scale this rockface, one of many you've climbed along your path. Then, all of a sudden, there is no more rock to climb. You see the piled stones and clamber over to them, moving as swiftly as possible. You fall to your knees in front of them, offering praise to the sisters for allowing you to reach your destination. The Lions of Vancouver have long overlooked the city, with many stories surrounding their formation. In an old tale, the Mountains were once two women of the Sto:lo, a part of the ancestry of the Canuck People, the oldest of their lineages. The women were married off to two foreign princes, to put an end to the war that raged between their people. This failed to bring peace, and the women turned to mountains in their grief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_waddington_ending;You have made it. The top of the World. The highest point in BC towers before you, only a few more metres to go before you stand higher than any Canuck. But you choose not to head to the top. You make a camp on the field of ice and snow, the only thing keeping the cold outside from taking you is the fire you've lit and the furs wrapped around you. You spend most of the night awake, praying to the spirit of this mountain that you won't die in the descent. The spirit of the mountain is a shy spirit, and not fond of mankind  trespassing on her territory. She was the first peak born of all the mountains, and when men first trod on her rock she was displeased by them. She slew many would-be climbers, clouding their road and leading them astray to die in the wilderness. You hope you are not her next victim as you nod off to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_colville_ending;The Path to Colville;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_colville_ending;At what you can only suspect to be the end of your hike, you find a circle of twelve sycamore trees, with a small pool of a malodorous oily substance in the center. The birds sing a pretty song, and you feel as though you could slide out of this world as one slides between curtains. The world around you darkens, and you see a red and white zig zag pattern descends over your vision, otherworldly music plays, and your hand stiffens. Finally, you exit the sycamore circle, and the world returns. Time has very clearly passed, and in your fist you have a piece of singed parchment, with the confused notes of a madman scrawled on it in your own hand. You're not sure what exactly you saw in those ancient woods, but you think you learned something from your time there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_golden_hind_ending;Glimmering Heights;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_golden_hind_ending;You stand on the top of the island and the top of the Golden Hinde, gazing out across the numerous peaks that surround you. You sit for a moment, feet sore from the trek, staring out into the wilderness, mountains on all sides of you, no sight of civilisation for kilometres. You breathe in the thin mountain air, and think of the journey back down, and how satisfying it shall be. You smile, and set your tired legs to walking again. The Golden Hinde was known originally as the Rooster's Comb, as the spirit of the mountain was a fierce fighting cock, known for killing those who trespassed on its territory. The beast was challenged one day by a spirit known as the Draque. The Draque offered his Golden Hind if he lost, but if he won the Rooster would be forced to let man enter his territory. The Draque won, and as a token of respect to the wager, humanity took to calling the mountain the Golden Hinde.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_greatbear_ending; It has been a difficult trek, but you've found it. The sacred spirit of this woodland has revealed itself to you. You gaze at the snow white Spirit for a moment, admiring it's fur and ethereal beauty as the beast drinks from the pool of crystal clear water. You move not a muscle as the bear slowly turns and walks away from the water, panting as it sits to relax. And then you see two more! Cubs, one black, one white, come running out from behind a tree, chasing one another and playing. Truly a magical moment, this is. Legend says the Great Bear Rainforest once covered all the northwest, and the people in those days were cruel to nature and tore it down piece by piece, taking the pelts of sacred spirit bears as trophies of sport. The Spirit of the Forest, the eponymous Great Bear was enraged by this, and her wrath turned many forests to ash as a punishment for the acts of mankind. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Fruits, meats, and carved totems are scattered around its roots in sacrifice to the spirit that dwells within, surely the most ancient of these august woodlands. In the days before the event, these woodlands were threatened by metal monsters, tools of mankind that cut the trees down, angering the spirits and the people in kind. The common Canuck, the Nuu-chah-nulth, even the far flung Mennonites called for this destruction to cease. Even when the ruler of this land decreed the woods protected, people disobeyed.

You enter it, muttering a prayer to the spi that dwells within, the spirit of the whole forest, as you sit at it's table and relax. You then leave the house, walking to the fire pit and lighting a fire to make a sacrifice to the spirit. You burn food and a wooden carving, putting the flame out with water drawn from the Ocean. Long ago, these woodlands were the home of John Muir of the Mountains, a folk hero to all Gaians from Prince George to the Sierra Nevadas. Muir was a well-respected sage, and a proud defender of Gaia in an age otherwise dominated by villains of all characters. His wife loved the woodlands of Sooke, so Muir settled there once all his great deeds were done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

While you sit upon the edge of the cliff, gazing out upon the land you just passed by, you think upon your home in this spot, covered in snow. In days long ago, a competition was held here, a part of the Olympics that all Gaians would partake in. People came from all over to this holy mounty, skis strapped to their feet, for this mountain was well known for grounds suited perfectly to skiing. Amongst all these rich and mighty athletes, one person stuck out, dressed in rags. They said they wanted to participate, with tattered skis tied to their bare feet. When the competition began, this beggar managed to trounce all the athletes who had trained for this for years. This was no beggar, rather the spirit of the mountain. The spirit jeered at the athletes as they arrived at the bottom, and when they reacted in anger the spirit revealed their true form, humbling these great men and sending them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

But this does not mean Man is doomed to futility, for only men can better the world in a demonstrable way. Many many years ago, before BC was even a land, before the Royal City or Gastown were founded, men came to this place for one thing. Gold. The spirit of the River was glad to let them take the gold, as it was a generous spirit, but then man built cities upon him. Dumped waste into him. So he stopped providing the people with gold. To this day, any gold found within those waters is negligent, if it exists at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

There, you spot it. The Man Turned to Stone. \n Long ago, when magicians and shapeshifters were commonplace, two of them met. The first was a Doctor, the second a servant of Gaia. The Doctor doubted this claim, and challenged the second to a transformation contest. The Doctor and the Servant struggled against each other for a long time, but the Doctor could not win, being turned to stone by the Servant.

Surrounding the narrows there is an astonishing display of Gaia's creatures. Tidal pools filled with crabs, anemones, snails, and other creatures of the sea.

You thank Gaia, the Spirits, and most of all the Gravedigger that you made it. The Graveyard of the Pacific, stretching from the mouth of the Columbia River to Cape Scott on the northern tip of Vancouver Island, is a particularly rough and tumultuous stretch of sea and the site in this region with the most religious import is the Pacific Rim.

As you crane your head downwards you can see the holding of Coeur D'alene, once a major city in pre-event times, now a humble village hugging the great lake that shares it's name. From here you can see the vague outlines of where the ancient city had been, aided by sporadic maintaince of it's roads as they turned from ancient asphalt, to paved stone, and finally dirt over the centuries.

As you make camp for the night before your return home in the morning, you reflect on the experience, recalling the stories of the Nez Perce who had lived in the canyon, and crossed it in their historic fight with the Ancient Americans of old.

EVTDESC_pend_orielle_ending;Your journey finds you at a rocky shore of the Lake Pend Orielle. Finally at the edge of the mighty lake, you partake in stone skipping across it's dark blue waters. You recall a story told to you by the locals, who call the lake "Ponderay", of the legendary cutthroat trout named "Virginia". The myths say this trout was over 15 men long, made of solid steel, and despite being sightless, navigated around the lake using sound alone. Some of them say this wicked troat was created by the Americans of old as a weapon of war, but these claims are far fetched. You watch the ripples of the water underneath your stones merge into the calm movements of the lake, pondering the nature of this lake and the demon fish that haunts it, wondering what the odds are of your sinking stone hitting Virginia's Side, your odds of even slightly inconveniencing such a creature. You conclude your thoughts, glad that man is no longer capable of distorting Gaia's creatures in such an unnatural way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The tunnels themselves had been built centuries ago, the Trailwalkers would say by Iron Horse or his followers, but fellow Gaians claim druids had built them to connect the isolated mountain tribesmen with the villages of the Silver Valley, permitted by Gaia through extensive rituals and offerings left for her for the right to impose their will upon nature. You retie the straps to your boots, remembering the many faces of the locals you passed in the tunnels and up the trail, and even now as an old man and his wife lead their mule loaded with goods to sell at market into the darkness of the tunnel, you better understand the blessings of Gaia's benevolence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As you traverse the trails you find a series of large footprints, the spirit is close. Following the footprints you come across a pristine mountain lake and at it’s shore stands a being resembling a human but larger and covered head to toe in fur, this is the spirit you’ve been looking for. The spirit turns around and briefly makes eye contact with you before walking back into the forest and disappearing into the undergrowth. Though none of your companions will believe you, you tracked down and saw the bigfooted spirit with your own eyes. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Celilo, Wyam, The Chutes: these falls have held many names over the years, but always held an important place in the hearts of all who lived along the banks of Mother Columbia or her children. The wicked men before the deluge trapped these waters behind walls of stone, but Gaia swept their walls away as she does all the schemes of men. Along the edges of the falls you see scattered fishing platforms and a great mass of market stalls on the shoreline, all celebrating the bounty of the great salmon harvest. You arrive to the marketplace, famished from a long day's journey';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
