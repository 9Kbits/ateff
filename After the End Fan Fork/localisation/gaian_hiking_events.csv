EVTDESC_garibaldi_ending; You can almost feel the magma churning below your feet as you and your entourage make your ways up, tied together to avoid falling off the ridge, ice axe in hand as you advance towards the summit of Mt. Garibaldi. It has been a tough climb, something rarely accomplished by modern humanity, hands cut by the ropes and feet aching. Here you are, ankle deep in snow as you stand on what must be the top of the world, sweating despite the frigid air. It is said that Garibaldi once walked this earth as a man, a fighter, a warrior who slew tyrants in a far off land before returning. He was infuriated when he saw his home submitted to Despotism and the Sickness of Man, and such was his fury that a mountain burst open, scattering liquid flame across it. Now Garibaldi wages his endless revolution. You hope your journey has pleased Him as you rest, looking out to the sun. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
