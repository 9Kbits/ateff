peaked_garibaldi;Peaked Garibaldi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_garibaldi_ending;Reaching Garibaldi's Summit ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_garibaldi_ending; You can almost feel the magma churning below your feet as you and your entourage make your ways up, tied together to avoid falling off the ridge, ice axe in hand as you advance towards the summit of Mt. Garibaldi. It has been a tough climb, something rarely accomplished by modern humanity, hands cut by the ropes and feet aching. Here you are, ankle deep in snow as you stand on what must be the top of the world, sweating despite the frigid air. It is said that Garibaldi once walked this earth as a man, a fighter, a warrior who slew tyrants in a far off land before returning. He was infuriated when he saw his home submitted to Despotism and the Sickness of Man, and such was his fury that a mountain burst open, scattering liquid flame across it. Now Garibaldi wages his endless revolution. You hope your journey has pleased Him as you rest, looking out to the sun. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_modelmyselfgaribaldi; I will model myself after this defender of Gaia... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
saw_greatbear; Saw the Great Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_greatbear_ending;Looking at Great Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_greatbear_ending; It has been a difficult trek, but you've found it. The sacred spirit of this woodland has revealed itself to you. You gaze at the snow white Spirit for a moment, admiring it's fur and ethereal beauty as the beast drinks from the pool of crystal clear water. You move not a muscle as the bear slowly turns and walks away from the water, panting as it sits to relax. And then you see two more! Cubs, one black, one white, come running out from behind a tree, chasing one another and playing. Truly a magical moment, this is. Legend says the Great Bear Rainforest once covered all the northwest, and the people in those days were cruel to nature and tore it down piece by piece, taking the pelts of sacred spirit bears as trophies of sport. The Spirit of the Forest, the eponymous Great Bear was enraged by this, and her wrath turned many forests to ash as a punishment for the acts of mankind. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carmanah_hike; Saw the Carmanah Giant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_carmanah_ending;Carmanah Creek Reached ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_carmanah_ending;After many days of travel, you have reached the end of the path. You stand at the base of the largest tree in the province, a worn and aged sign before you indicating its height. This is the Carmanah Giant, the behemoth of the island. Fruits, meats, and carved totems are scattered around its roots in sacrifice to the spirit that dwells within, surely the most ancient of these august woodlands. In the days before the event, these woodlands were threatened by metal monsters, tools of mankind that cut the trees down, angering the spirits and the people in kind. The common Canuck, the Nuu-chah-nulth, even the far flung Mennonites called for this destruction to cease. Even when the ruler of this land decreed the woods protected, people disobeyed. Thus is the folly of greed... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
canadian_muir;Visited the Home of Muir ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTITLE_sooke_ending;At the depths of Sooke ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_sooke_ending;You've followed the trail through these woodlands and arrived at the other side, the ancient Cabin standing on the edge of the Pacific, the edge of the world. You enter it, muttering a prayer to the spi that dwells within, the spirit of the whole forest, as you sit at it's table and relax. You then leave the house, walking to the fire pit and lighting a fire to make a sacrifice to the spirit. You burn food and a wooden carving, putting the flame out with water drawn from the Ocean. Long ago, these woodlands were the home of John Muir of the Mountains, a folk hero to all Gaians from Prince George to the Sierra Nevadas. Muir was a well-respected sage, and a proud defender of Gaia in an age otherwise dominated by villains of all characters. His wife loved the woodlands of Sooke, so Muir settled there once all his great deeds were done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_bowen_ending;Overlooking the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_bowen_ending;You have reached Bowen lookout, the end of your journey, and it has been a long one indeed. While you sit upon the edge of the cliff, gazing out upon the land you just passed by, you think upon your home in this spot, covered in snow. In days long ago, a competition was held here, a part of the Olympics that all Gaians would partake in. People came from all over to this holy mounty, skis strapped to their feet, for this mountain was well known for grounds suited perfectly to skiing. Amongst all these rich and mighty athletes, one person stuck out, dressed in rags. They said they wanted to participate, with tattered skis tied to their bare feet. When the competition began, this beggar managed to trounce all the athletes who had trained for this for years. This was no beggar, rather the spirit of the mountain. The spirit jeered at the athletes as they arrived at the bottom, and when they reacted in anger the spirit revealed their true form, humbling these great men and sending them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_fraser_ending;The Walk through Fraser;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_fraser_ending;As you walk along the Shore of the fair-flowing Fraser, you spy the crumbling and rusted ruin of a bridge, spanning the mighty river, wrapped in vines. You see not a man crossing it, nor shall you likely ever, and you contemplate this. All man has constructed has eventually been destroyed, all your works worn eventually to dust against nature. But this does not mean Man is doomed to futility, for only men can better the world in a demonstrable way. Many many years ago, before BC was even a land, before the Royal City or Gastown were founded, men came to this place for one thing. Gold. The spirit of the River was glad to let them take the gold, as it was a generous spirit, but then man built cities upon him. Dumped waste into him. So he stopped providing the people with gold. To this day, any gold found within those waters is negligent, if it exists at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTITLE_harrison_ending;The Waters at Transformer Point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_harrison_ending;Your Canoe creaks and groans as you guide it along the shoreline of Lake Harrison, eyes scanning the shoreline for the marker that guides Hikers to their destination. Then you spot it - a silver cloth banner fluttering in the wind, just 'round the corner. You speed your rowing, rounding the bend and leaping out of your canoe, rushing to the shoreline. There, you spot it. The Man Turned to Stone. \n Long ago, when magicians and shapeshifters were commonplace, two of them met. The first was a Doctor, the second a servant of Gaia. The Doctor doubted this claim, and challenged the second to a transformation contest. The Doctor and the Servant struggled against each other for a long time, but the Doctor could not win, being turned to stone by the Servant. His people are currently wrapping a blanket around you, welcoming you to their village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
