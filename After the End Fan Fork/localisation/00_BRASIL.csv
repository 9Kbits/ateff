##ARTIFACTS##
cristo_redentor;Cristo Redentor Statuette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cristo_redentor_desc;An intricately-crafted stone replica of the famous Cristo Redentor statue outside the imperial capital of Brazil. Despite its humble appearance, statuettes such as these are exceedingly rare, and having one is a sign that the Emperor of Brazil has true respect for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tourmaline_amulet;Tourmaline Amulet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tourmaline_amulet_desc;This amulet's centerpiece is a blue gemstone. The hue is more intense and dazzling than any other jewel, and it is said that this particular gem can only be found in a particular region of Brazil. They are rare enough in Brazil, to say nothing of the outside world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soccer_ball;Futebol;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
soccer_ball_desc;This black-and-white sphere, known as a "futebol", is said to be the pre-Event version of a common ball. This particular ball has special significance, however - it was once kicked by the legendary Saint Pelé, and balls of this type cannot be made using today's technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oriental_rug;Oriental Rug;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oriental_rug_desc;Despite its name, this highly-intricate rug was not made in the eastern parts of Brazil. This style of rug is said to have originated with travelers from the far East in the days before the Event, and it has since become popular with the Brazilian elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carranca;Carranca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carranca_desc;This menacing-looking wooden carving originated as a good luck charm in the Northeast of Brazil, although you cannot imagine how such an artifact could bring comfort to those who saw it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paubrasilia_dyed_robes;Brazilian Robes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paubrasilia_dyed_robes_desc;These robes are noticeable for their deep red hue, made using dye from a paubrasilia tree. This hue, associated as it is with the mighty Brazilian Empire, inspires awe and respect from anyone who sees it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silk_shroud;Silk Shroud;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
silk_shroud_desc;Rumored to have belonged to the renowned Fátima, first Empress of Brazil, this masterfully crafted silk shroud shimmers in the light and draws the attention of all who see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_reliquary;Brazilian Reliquary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_reliquary_desc;This box is said to contain a body part from a famed Brazilian saint, although you have also been instructed not to open this box under any circumstances. However, lightly shaking the box will reveal the claim to be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jungle_knife;Jungle Knife;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jungle_knife_desc;This absolutely gigantic blade is closer to a sword than it is to a knife. Blades of this exact type were once wielded by the most fearsome pre-Event Brazilian soldiers, and they continue to be used today as both tools and weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_prev_emperor_sculpture;Small Figurine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_figurine_name;Figurine of [offmap_china.PrevRuler.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

berimbau;Berimbau;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dragoon_lance;Dragoon Lance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dragoon_lance_desc;This finely-crafted lance dates to before the Event, and was used by one of the original Independence Dragoons during the great war that established the Brazilian Empire. It has been lovingly maintained through the ages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_firearm;Taurus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_firearm;This Taurus, or "Bull", certainly earns its name. A rare example of a pre-Event firearm, this particular example is finely decorated with gold and steel which never rusts. It is both more powerful and more intimidating than a typical pre-Event firearm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paubrasilia_sculpture;Paubrasilia Sculpture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paubrasilia_sculpture_desc;This wooden sculpture has been carved entirely out of paubrasilia. Paubrasilia is an incredibly rare and prestigious commodity outside of Brazil, so this sculpture is worth far more than a typical wooden carving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_painting_of_glitterhoof;Painting of Casco da Cintilação;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_painting_of_glitterhoof_desc;A beautiful painting of the horse of a former Emperor, a great steed by the name of Casco da Cintilação. It is wearing an elaborately crafted silken gown, making it look most regal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_tapestry;Coffee Current Tapestry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_tapestry_name;Tapestry of [tapestry_target.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

brazilian_tapestry_grand;Grand Brazilian Tapestry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_tapestry_grand_desc;A magnificent tapestry showing the splendor of Brazil and its Emperor. It depicts Brazilian armies in a triumphant victory over a barbaric horde, and a grand jaguar - a symbol of imperial authority - looking down at them from a tall tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carta_armor;Carta Armor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carta_armor_desc;This peculiar-looking set of armor was manufactured in a small and isolated pavilion in São Paulo by a secretive group of craftsmen. Despite its odd appearance, it is highly effective at deflecting blows from even the sharpest of swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guerilla_warfare;Guerilla Warfare;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
guerilla_warfare_desc;This legendary book on unconventional warfare was originally penned by the legendary warrior Che Guevara. Although most believe he was Cuban, Brazilians insist that he was originally born in Gaúcho country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_guarani;The Guarani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_guarani_desc;This book, detailing the life of an ancient feudal lord in the uncharted Brazilian inland, is one of the few pre-Event works of Brazilian literature to survive the Event intact, and is still a compelling tale of adventure and romance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_book_health;Brazilian Compendium of Medicine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_book_health_desc;This beautifully bound book tells of the many fascinating aspects of Chinese medicine and its various uses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_book_action;Illustrated Brazilian Action Story;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_book_action_desc;This peculiar-looking book comes from a small area of São Paulo. This epic chronicle has been meticulously preserved and copied by modern artists. Although it is very much a niche story, it remains popular in certain areas of São Paulo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_book_history;Peace and Prosperity for Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brazilian_book_history_desc;This in-depth biography of the second Emperor of Brazil, Pedro the Magnanimous, can be somewhat dry at times. Nevertheless, it does inspire thoughts of having a realm as prosperous as his...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Events
EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_DYN;A new Dynasty has risen in Brazil as the House of [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] has been supplanted by the House of [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]. However, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], apparently seeks to pursue the same [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Policy as [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor. [From.GetDynName] likes [From.Offmap.GetLike] and dislikes [From.Offmap.GetDislike].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_DYN_NEW_POLICY;A new Dynasty has risen in Brazil as the House of [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] has been supplanted by the House of [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]. The new [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], favors an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Brazil, and is abandoning the [From.Offmap.GetPrevPolicy] Policy of [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor. [From.GetDynName] likes [From.Offmap.GetLike] and dislikes [From.Offmap.GetDislike].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50001;[FromFrom.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.GetDynName], the Brazilian 'August [FromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap]', has died and been succeeded by [From.GetDynName]. Like [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress] is known to believe in an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Brazil. Apparently, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] takes a special interest in [From.Offmap.GetLike] but frowns on [From.Offmap.GetDislike].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_POLICY;[FromFrom.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.GetDynName], known for [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] [From.Offmap.GetPrevPolicy] Policy, has died and [From.GetDynName] now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne. It is said that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] especially appreciates [From.Offmap.GetLike] but despises [From.Offmap.GetDislike]. Unlike [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress] is known to favor the idea of an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_OPEN;Brazil has abandoned its [FromFrom.GetPrevPolicy] ways and is now open to trade and business as usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_ISO;Brazil has gone from [FromFrom.GetPrevPolicy] to Isolationist. The August [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSonDaughterCap], [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], is turning [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] back on the gringo world that surrounds Brazil's perfection in order to [GetChinaIsolationPastime].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_EXP;The great [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] of Brazil has suddenly taken a keen interest in the rest of the world, particularly the North. This new Expansionist Policy could bode ill for neighboring rulers who are not in Brazil's good graces.\n\nThe snake is smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_STABLE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Things are returning to normal and the August Empire seems stable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_UNREST;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Popular uprisings have broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion] and large groups of disgruntled peasants have taken up arms, led by [GetRandomChineseFaction]. Trade has been halved along the Coffee Current and Brazil will not be able to defend its Tributary states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_FAMINE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Brazil has recently been suffering from droughts and the people are starving as a Great Famine upsets the prosperity of the August Empire. The maritime fleets of the Coffee Current have virtually ceased and the great Brazilian artisans are simply trying to survive. Brazil will not be able to assist its Tributary states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_PLAGUE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. The Pale Rider is sowing his deadly seeds in Brazil - a Devastating Plague has broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion]. No goods travel along the Coffee Current as the merchants fear infection. Even so, the deadly scourge is spreading quickly, and the troubles of Brazil could soon be ours... Brazil will not be able to assist its Tributary states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_MONGOLS;[offmap_china.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must be displeased with the Ember-Red Throne, for a great Amazomense Confederation has managed to cross the mighty fortifications of Northern Brazil, intent on disrupting the harmony and prosperity of 'Pindorama'. [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName] is mustering [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] armies in [GetRandomChineseRegion] for a swift response, but [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] could be in for a long war...\n\nFor tributary states of Brazil this means that their suzerain will be unable to lend them military aid. Others point out that it is an opportune time to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_JURCHENS;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must have decided to punish the arrogance of the corrupt Brazilian regime, for a great Gaúcho Horde has recently disrupted the stability of 'Pindorama'. Led by their great Caudillo, numberless fierce riders have crossed the Iguaçu river and invaded Southeastern Brazil, apparently intent on conquering the whole empire. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is slowly gathering [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] forces in [GetRandomChineseRegion], but many are already questioning whether [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] has lost their Divine Right...\n\nFor tributary states of Brazil this means that their suzerain will be unable to lend them military aid. Others point out that it is an opportune time to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_CW;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Civil War now rocks Brazil as a rebellious governor has managed to gather support from the local military officers in [GetRandomChineseRegion]. Coffee Current profits are halved and Tributary states can use this opportunity to break free - Brazil will not be able to assist them should they be attacked anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_GOLDEN;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Peace and prosperity are blossoming throughout Brazil under the benevolent rule of [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName]. New types of coffee, sugar, and other wondrous new wares have started to flow along the increasingly safe routes of the Coffee Current, whose wealth has doubled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50141_BOOST;With Brazil already suffering from the [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Amazomense Confederation has decided to exploit the situation and has crossed into Northern Brazil. Will the fierce warriors from the endless jungle manage to break the Jaguar's back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50141_PENALTY;Right when Brazil is experiencing an almost unprecedented [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Amazomense Confederation has crossed into Mato Grosso, intent on conquering the whole empire, but the Jaguar is mighty and the fierce jungle warriors are in for a titanic struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50161;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the veteran armies of Brazil finally managed to win a decisive battle near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Amazomense Tamoio was slain and his chiefs slaughtered to the last man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50161;Beware the Jaguar of the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50162;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the Amazomense finally stand triumphant. The decisive battle was fought near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Amazomense Tamoio now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne as [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName], founder of a new Dynasty! However, Brazil is likely to suffer Unrest for many years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50162;The Amazonense truly are fearsome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50181_BOOST;With Brazil already suffering from the [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], an additional misfortune has struck the August Empire - the Gaúcho tribes from the Chuí river have united under a great Caudillo. A great horde of fierce horse warriors is now crossing into Brazil from the Southern Cone. Clearly, this is no ordinary raid to test the Brazilian defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50181_PENALTY;Right when Brazil is experiencing an almost unprecedented [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Gaúcho Horde has crossed the Iguaçu river, invading the Southeast. However, the Jaguar is mighty and the fierce warriors of the plains are in for a titanic struggle, for the great riches of Pindorama are defended by a million well-equipped soldiers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50201;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the veteran armies of Brazil finally managed to win a decisive battle near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Gaúcho Caudillo was slain and his elite guards slaughtered to the last man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50201;The Jaguar roars...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50202;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the Gaúchos finally stand triumphant. The decisive battle was fought near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Gaúcho Caudillo now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], founder of a new Dynasty! However, Brazil is likely to suffer Unrest for many years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50202;These Gaúchos sound dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50302_BROKEN_PEACE_DEAL;Curses, there goes my Peace Deal with Brazil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50281_UNREST;The long period of Unrest and sporadic popular uprisings in Brazil has turned into a full-blown Civil War! Many think that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is weak and has lost their Divine Right to rule. Even as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] cowers in [GetRandomChineseRegion], massive rebel armies are on the move, attacking loyalist strongholds. Still, the rebels have not yet gathered under a single leader, and different factions are even fighting each other. Coffee Current profits are halved and Tributary states can use this opportunity to break free - Brazil will not be able to assist them should they be attacked anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50301;The Brazilian Civil War has come to an abrupt end. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] utterly crushed the main rebel army in [GetRandomChineseRegion], ending the long years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances between loyalists, rabble-rousing monks, dynastic pretenders and an overly ambitious governor. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50301;Good, I can't be spoken to until I have coffee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50302_HAN_DYNASTY;After years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances, the Brazilian Civil War is finally over. The foreign dynasty has fallen and Brazil is once more ruled by a native Brazilian [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress]. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], the former governor of [GetRandomChineseRegion], defeated not just the loyalist armies, but several rival rebel factions. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50302_NEW_DYNASTY;After years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances, the Brazilian Civil War is finally over. A warlike Apostolic priest from [GetRandomChineseRegion] has emerged victorious and now rules as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName]. A man of the people, the new [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] has cleaned out the corrupt bureaucrats of the old regime. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50303;After years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances, the Brazilian Civil War is finally over. The old regime has fallen and [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], a pretender prince of the old [FromFrom.Ruler.Dynasty.GetName] has emerged victorious and now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_JD_20024;[Root.GetGovernorLetterGreeting]. [Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing].\n\nThe magnanimous [From.Offmap.Ruler.GetLongChineseEmperorName], has graciously accepted your gift. The generosity of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty will not be forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
