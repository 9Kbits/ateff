paubrasilia_sculpture_name;Paubrasilia Sculpture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

#Events
EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_DYN;A new Dynasty has risen in Brazil as the House of [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] has been supplanted by the House of [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]. However, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], apparently seeks to pursue the same [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Policy as [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor. [From.GetDynName] likes [From.Offmap.GetLike] and dislikes [From.Offmap.GetDislike].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_DYN_NEW_POLICY;A new Dynasty has risen in Brazil as the House of [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] has been supplanted by the House of [From.GetOnlyDynastyName]. The new [From.GetEmperorEmpress], [From.GetDynName], favors an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Brazil, and is abandoning the [From.Offmap.GetPrevPolicy] Policy of [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor. [From.GetDynName] likes [From.Offmap.GetLike] and dislikes [From.Offmap.GetDislike].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50001;[FromFrom.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.GetDynName], the Brazilian 'August [FromFrom.GetSonDaughterCap]', has died and been succeeded by [From.GetDynName]. Like [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress] is known to believe in an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Brazil. Apparently, [From.GetSubjectPronoun] takes a special interest in [From.Offmap.GetLike] but frowns on [From.Offmap.GetDislike].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50001_NEW_POLICY;[FromFrom.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.GetDynName], known for [FromFrom.GetPossPronoun] [From.Offmap.GetPrevPolicy] Policy, has died and [From.GetDynName] now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne. It is said that [From.GetSubjectPronoun] especially appreciates [From.Offmap.GetLike] but despises [From.Offmap.GetDislike]. Unlike [From.GetPossPronoun] predecessor, the new [From.GetEmperorEmpress] is known to favor the idea of an [From.Offmap.GetPolicy] Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_OPEN;Brazil has abandoned its [FromFrom.GetPrevPolicy] ways and is now open to trade and business as usual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_ISO;Brazil has gone from [FromFrom.GetPrevPolicy] to Isolationist. The August [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSonDaughterCap], [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], is turning [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] back on the gringo world that surrounds Brazil's perfection in order to [GetChinaIsolationPastime].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50021_EXP;The great [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] of Brazil has suddenly taken a keen interest in the rest of the world, particularly the North. This new Expansionist Policy could bode ill for neighboring rulers who are not in Brazil's good graces.\n\nThe snake is smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_STABLE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Things are returning to normal and the August Empire seems stable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_UNREST;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Popular uprisings have broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion] and large groups of disgruntled peasants have taken up arms, led by [GetRandomChineseFaction]. Trade has been halved along the Coffee Current and Brazil will not be able to defend its Tributary states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_FAMINE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Brazil has recently been suffering from droughts and the people are starving as a Great Famine upsets the prosperity of the August Empire. The maritime fleets of the Coffee Current have virtually ceased and the great Brazilian artisans are simply trying to survive. Brazil will not be able to assist its Tributary states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_PLAGUE;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. The Pale Rider is sowing his deadly seeds in Brazil - a Devastating Plague has broken out in [GetRandomChineseRegion]. No goods travel along the Coffee Current as the merchants fear infection. Even so, the deadly scourge is spreading quickly, and the troubles of Brazil could soon be ours... Brazil will not be able to assist its Tributary states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_MONGOLS;[offmap_china.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must be displeased with the Ember-Red Throne, for a great Amazomense Confederation has managed to cross the mighty fortifications of Northern Brazil, intent on disrupting the harmony and prosperity of 'Pindorama'. [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName] is mustering [offmap_china.Ruler.GetHerHis] armies in [GetRandomChineseRegion] for a swift response, but [offmap_china.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] could be in for a long war...\n\nFor tributary states of Brazil this means that their suzerain will be unable to lend them military aid. Others point out that it is an opportune time to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_JURCHENS;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. [Root.Religion.GetHighGodNameCap] must have decided to punish the arrogance of the corrupt Brazilian regime, for a great Gaúcho Horde has recently disrupted the stability of 'Pindorama'. Led by their great Caudillo, numberless fierce riders have crossed the Iguaçu river and invaded Southeastern Brazil, apparently intent on conquering the whole empire. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is slowly gathering [FromFrom.Ruler.GetPossPronoun] forces in [GetRandomChineseRegion], but many are already questioning whether [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] has lost their Divine Right...\n\nFor tributary states of Brazil this means that their suzerain will be unable to lend them military aid. Others point out that it is an opportune time to break free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_CW;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Civil War now rocks Brazil as a rebellious governor has managed to gather support from the local military officers in [GetRandomChineseRegion]. Coffee Current profits are halved and Tributary states can use this opportunity to break free - Brazil will not be able to assist them should they be attacked anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50031_GOLDEN;[FromFrom.GetChinaPreviousStatusEnd]. Peace and prosperity are blossoming throughout Brazil under the benevolent rule of [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName]. New types of coffee, sugar, and other wondrous new wares have started to flow along the increasingly safe routes of the Coffee Current, whose wealth has doubled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50141_BOOST;With Brazil already suffering from the [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Amazomense Confederation has decided to exploit the situation and has crossed into Northern Brazil. Will the fierce warriors from the endless jungle manage to break the Jaguar's back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50141_PENALTY;Right when Brazil is experiencing an almost unprecedented [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Amazomense Confederation has crossed into Mato Grosso, intent on conquering the whole empire, but the Jaguar is mighty and the fierce jungle warriors are in for a titanic struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50161;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the veteran armies of Brazil finally managed to win a decisive battle near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Amazomense Tamoio was slain and his chiefs slaughtered to the last man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50161;Beware the Jaguar of the South...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50162;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the Amazomense finally stand triumphant. The decisive battle was fought near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Amazomense Tamoio now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne as [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [offmap_china.Ruler.GetDynName], founder of a new Dynasty! However, Brazil is likely to suffer Unrest for many years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50162;The Amazonians truly are fearsome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50181_BOOST;With Brazil already suffering from the [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], an additional misfortune has struck the August Empire - the Gaúcho tribes from the Chuí river have united under a great Caudillo. A great horde of fierce horse warriors is now crossing into Brazil from the Southern Cone. Clearly, this is no ordinary raid to test the Brazilian defenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50181_PENALTY;Right when Brazil is experiencing an almost unprecedented [offmap_china.GetPrevStatus], a great Gaúcho Horde has crossed the Iguaçu river, invading the Southeast. However, the Jaguar is mighty and the fierce warriors of the plains are in for a titanic struggle, for the great riches of Pindorama are defended by a million well-equipped soldiers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50201;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the veteran armies of Brazil finally managed to win a decisive battle near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Gaúcho Caudillo was slain and his elite guards slaughtered to the last man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50201;The Jaguar roars...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50202;After years of constant warfare and battles involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers, the Gaúchos finally stand triumphant. The decisive battle was fought near [GetRandomChineseRegion]. The Gaúcho Caudillo now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], founder of a new Dynasty! However, Brazil is likely to suffer Unrest for many years to come...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50202;These Gaúchos sound dangerous...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50302_BROKEN_PEACE_DEAL;Curses, there goes my Peace Deal with Brazil!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50281_UNREST;The long period of Unrest and sporadic popular uprisings in Brazil has turned into a full-blown Civil War! Many think that [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] is weak and has lost their Divine Right to rule. Even as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetSubjectPronoun] cowers in [GetRandomChineseRegion], massive rebel armies are on the move, attacking loyalist strongholds. Still, the rebels have not yet gathered under a single leader, and different factions are even fighting each other. Coffee Current profits are halved and Tributary states can use this opportunity to break free - Brazil will not be able to assist them should they be attacked anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50301;The Brazilian Civil War has come to an abrupt end. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName] utterly crushed the main rebel army in [GetRandomChineseRegion], ending the long years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances between loyalists, rabble-rousing monks, dynastic pretenders and an overly ambitious governor. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPT_JD_50301;Good, I can't be spoken to until I have coffee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50302_HAN_DYNASTY;After years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances, the Brazilian Civil War is finally over. The foreign dynasty has fallen and Brazil is once more ruled by a native Brazilian [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress]. [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], the former governor of [GetRandomChineseRegion], defeated not just the loyalist armies, but several rival rebel factions. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50302_NEW_DYNASTY;After years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances, the Brazilian Civil War is finally over. A warlike Apostolic priest from [GetRandomChineseRegion] has emerged victorious and now rules as [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName]. A man of the people, the new [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] has cleaned out the corrupt bureaucrats of the old regime. Things are slowly returning to normal in the August Empire and the Coffee Current is safe again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_50303;After years of confusing warfare and shifting alliances, the Brazilian Civil War is finally over. The old regime has fallen and [FromFrom.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] [FromFrom.Ruler.GetDynName], a pretender prince of the old [FromFrom.Ruler.Dynasty.GetName] has emerged victorious and now sits upon the Ember-Red Throne.

EVTTITLE_plscometobr_1;The Journey Begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_1;The journey to visit the [offmap_china.Ruler.GetEmperorEmpress] of the [offmap_china.GetName] and show my subservience will take months if not even years. I take my farewells to my near and dear and prepare the caravan for departure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_1;Let us prepare...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_plscometobr_3;A Voyage to Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_3;Because your capital is along the coast, you are able to sail directly to Rio de Janeiro. This is convenient, as sea voyages to Brazil are both quicker and cheaper than overland journeys through the Amazon rainforest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_3;Let's set sail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_plscometobr_4;A Trek Through the Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_4;As your capital does not have easy access to the coast, you have decided to make an overland journey to Brazil. Overland journeys to Brazil are long, ardous, and dangerous, not least because you must traverse the Amazon rainforest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_4;Let's get going!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_BR_TRIP_BOA_VISTA;The Path to Boa Vista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_6;Our caravan has been camped by the roadside the whole day. The sky has been pouring over us with unusually heavy rain. The whole situation has brought my thoughts to the memories of my late [target_relative.GetRootRelation], [target_relative.GetFirstName].;Notre caravane campe le long des routes toute la journée. Nous subissons de fortes pluies. Toute cette situation m'a amené à penser à feu m[target_relative.GetOnA] [target_relative.GetRootRelation] [target_relative.GetFirstName].;Unsere Karawane hat den ganzen Tag am Stra§enrand verbracht. Der Himmel hat uns mit ungewöhnlich hartem Regen gestraft. Die ganze Situation hat meine Gedanken auf meine[target_relative.GetnMale] verstorbene[target_relative.GetnMale] [target_relative.GetRootRelation], [target_relative.GetFirstName] gelenkt.;;Nuestra caravana lleva todo el día acampada en la cuneta. Está lloviendo con una fuerza inusitada. Esta situación me ha hecho pensar en mi difunto/a [target_relative.GetRootRelation], [target_relative.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_7;The unusually heavy rain has not let up, and your caravan has once again stopped along the road - but not by choice. Your team has informed you that many of your wagons have broken down, and that it will take several days before your caravan is ready to travel again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_7;I have a deck of cards. Let's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_7_TT;You gamble with your caravan team. You might win, or you might lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_7;I will keep morale up by spinning a good yarn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_7_TT;You decide to tell some stories to your team during their break. This may increase your diplomacy skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_7;It's a good thing I brought my books...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_7_TT;Read a few books, potentially increasing your skills in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_plscometobr_7;I have to do my part. I'll help my team repair the caravan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_plscometobr_7_TT;Working in the rain may not be good for your health...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_8;It has been a few days since you decided to help your team repair your caravan. The good news is that you're back on the road and the weather appears to be clearing up. The bad news is that you appear to have come down with a case of pneumonia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_8;I should have taken it easier...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_9;Your caravan has been advancing briskly along the path to Boa Vista. The weather is ideal for a long trek, and you find yourself being stunned by the ever-changing landscape as your trip continues. Surely, this is a good portent for your eventual meeting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_9;I feel energized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_9;And yet, I don't feel any better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_9;Enough gawking - let's keep moving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_10;Our caravan has been approached by a smooth-faced [brazilian_trader.Culture.GetName] [brazilian_trader.GetManWoman], claiming to be a renowned trader. After finally getting my attention [brazilian_trader.GetSheHe] beckons me over to [brazilian_trader.GetHerHis] own horse, where something is strapped to its saddle. 'Name's [brazilian_trader.GetBestName], my good [Root.GetLordLady]! Might my latest acquisition interest you?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_10;Ooh, that looks [brazilian_artifact.GetArtifactDescriptor]. Let me take it off your hands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_10_TT;§Y[brazilian_artifact.GetName]§! is transfered to your Treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_10;You're certainly a charmer... I could use someone like you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_10_TT;The [brazilian_trader.GetManWoman] eyes you up and down, before shrugging in agreement.\n§Y[brazilian_trader.GetTitledName]§! joins your court.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_10;Guards. I'm suddenly in the mood for a gift...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_10_TT;You order your guards to cut down the trader and steal the goods for you.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_plscometobr_10;Flattery gets you nowhere, peddler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_plscometobr_10_TT;You have better things to do.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_11;A rider approached the caravan and handed me a letter with the seal of [target_host.GetBestName]. [target_host.GetFirstName] has heard of my travels and invites our party to rest for a while in the warmth of the [target_host.GetCapitalHolding] [target_host.Capital.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_11;This could prove to be an opportunity to get even.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTOOLTIPA_plscometobr_11;You utilize your rival's hospitality to set up a risky murder attempt on them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_11;A warm bed and a hot meal is most welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_11_RIVAL;Is my old rival prepared to bury the hatchet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTOOLTIPB_plscometobr_11;You accept the invitation to the court of [target_host.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_11;I prefer my tent as accommodation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_plscometobr_12;A warm hearth and healthy meals has invigorated the whole company, but after enjoying the hospitality of [target_host.GetTitledFirstName] for some days it's now time to get moving on our path towards [offmap_china.GetName] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_plscometobr_12The previous days have certainly been a delight. I never imagined that we could have so many things in common. It's with regret that I bid farewell to [target_host.GetTitledFirstName] when we decide to move on towards our goal of [offmap_china.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_plscometobr_12;We are presented with a deliciously looking meal when [target_host.GetTitledFirstName] raises [target_host.GetHerHis] chalice to honor us with a toast. Longing for a good drink I take a big gulp before I notice that [target_host.GetFirstName] turns [target_host.GetHerHis] chalice upside down emptying its content on the floor, laughing manically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_12;Thank you for being an excellent host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_12;Let's keep in touch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_12;Thank you but we need to be on our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_plscometobr_12;No, you! You...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPD_plscometobr_12;The room starts spinning and you black out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_13;Regaining my conciousness I find myself in the ditch to the side of the road. In my pocket I discover a letter with the firmest handwriting reading 'This is your last warning, stay out of here!'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_13;I have a terrible ache in my whole body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTTOOLTIPA_JD_32112;You turn over and empty your bowels in the ditch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_plscometobr_14;'Trust is such a delicate thing', I tell my horse galloping away in the dark night, accompanied by the sound of screams and clattering plates while panic ensues behind us. Some of my servants also had to put their life to it for the whole charade to be believable, but that is an acceptable price to pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_plscometobr_14;Just as you are about to make your escape into the dead of the night you are apprehended by the Captain of the guard. Sweat started forming on the temples of your head. Any second now.\nThere's the bellowing scream of [target_host.GetTitledFirstName]'s guts exploding. For a split second you notice the shock in the face of the Captain, as someone exclaims that the [target_host.GetTitle] is dead. Then his eyes refocus on you. Without hesitation, the burly man raises his sword and cuts you in half.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_plscometobr_14;During the dinner, [target_host.GetTitledFirstName], exclaims that [target_host.GetSheHe] has a present for you. Seconds later a man with an arrow sticking out of his back is dragged into the room. With fear you immediately recognize the man from your company that you ordered to assassinate [target_host.GetFirstName]. With a finger pointed towards your head [target_host.GetFirstName] shouts 'I sentence you all to die for your treachery!'. From every corner of the room, guards with drawn weapons are closing a circle fast around your band.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_14[target_host.GetSheHeCap] should have known better than to trust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_14;Now we're even!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_14;There is no escape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_15;As your caravan advances along the road to Boa Vista, you spot what appears to be a corpse lying ahead of you in the road. However, as you continue to approach it, the "corpse" suddenly springs up and starts running towards your cart. Your guards are about to cut the madman down when you order them to stop - he is begging for help in your own tongue! He explains that he, too, was traveling to Brazil, but his caravan met a disasterous fate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_15;I will give you some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_15;I do not care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_15;Take as much gold as you need!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_plscometobr_15;Our wagons have room for one more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_BOA_VISTA_ARRIVAL;Arrival at Boa Vista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_16;After a long journey through the jungles of Central America, you have finally arrived at Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima and the northernmost outpost of the ancient Brazilian empire. As you stop in the city to gather supplies, you contemplate the journey ahead. From here, you must journey south to the Amazon river, board a ship, and brave the dangers of the vast rainforest until you reach Belém on the Atlantic coast. From there, you can sail freely to Rio de Janeiro.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_16;I must prepare well for my journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_BR_TRIP_AMAZON;The Heart of Darkness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JD_15002;As your boat sails down the Amazon river, you are hailed by a passing ship. "Halt!", announces its captain.\n'I am [other_ruler.GetTitledName]. We are currently guarding the Amazon River on behalf of the [offmap_china.GetFullName]... You, my fine [Root.GetLordLady], need to pay the river toll.' The smirk on the [other_ruler.GetManWoman]'s face makes me hesitate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JD_15002;Welcome to the jungle, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_20_tt;You and your entourage are let through.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_20;We will have none of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_20_tt;You hurl a spear at the [other_ruler.GetTitle] before [other_ruler.GetSheHe] has time to finish smirking.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_20;I won't give in to idle threats. Guards, my sword  now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_21;'Aaah, fellow travelers!' a military [other_ruler.GetManWoman] exclaims, emerging alongside a group of soldiers from the dense rainforest surrounding our camp. 'I am [other_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]. We are here to escort my [Root.GetLordLady] to [Root.GetRandomChineseRegion].' [other_ruler.GetSheHeCap] gestures for [Root.GetHerHis] troops to join my entourage for the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_21;Oh, [other_ruler.GetTitledFirstName]! There's... been a change of plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_21_tt;While you obviously did not hire these mercenaries, you caravan might benefit from some more military protection.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_21;I think you have me confused with someone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_21_tt;You explain the situation. The mercenaries are disappointed, but soon leave you and your people alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_22;A raft containing soliders blocks your ship's path as it sails down the river. 'Please, we have not eaten in months', a tall [other_ruler.GetManWoman] pleads, before paddling towards your ship: 'I am [other_ruler.GetTitledName]. You will let us dine with your people tonight...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_22;No need for posturing, [other_ruler.GetTitle]. We have enough food for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_22_tt;§Y[other_ruler.GetTitledName]§! and [other_ruler.GetHerHis] soldiers appreciate your generosity.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_22;The [offmap_china.GetFullName] clearly does nothing for you... You should work for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_22_tt;§Y[other_ruler.GetTitle]§! abandons [other_ruler.GetHerHis] mercenary way of life and joins your court instead.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_22;We cannot afford to take pity on strangers...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_22_tt;The mercenaries get out of your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_23;After a long day of sailing down the mighty Amazon, you stop to camp along its banks for the night. As your entourage cooks dinner, you suddenly hear something stirring in the jungle behind you. You wheel around to face the disturbance, only to see two bright yellow eyes peering at you from the dense jungle. Their owner suddenly pounces into the clearing, leaving you standing face-to-face with an emaciated jaguar. It clearly thinks you will be its next meal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_23;Help me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jaguar_bodyguard_help_tt;Your hired mercenaries run to your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jaguar_encounter_tt;Your guards scramble to help you slay the beast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_24;As your boat sails downriver, an arrow suddenly whizzes past your head, narrowly missing you. You look around to spot the person who fired it, only to see one of your guards get hit by a second arrow. As you hit the deck, you hear dozens of other arrows flying overhead, along with an eerie-sounding battle cry. Your ship is being ambushed by Amazonian natives!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_24;Guards! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
natives_uninjured_tt;You escape uninjured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
natives_wounded_tt;You are wounded by a stray arrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
natives_severely_injured_tt;You are severely wounded by a well-aimed arrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
natives_death_tt;One of the arrows strikes true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_25;A thick mist descends across the great river as your boat continues its journey down the Amazon. Suddenly, you find yourself surrounded by armed soldiers in front of what looks to be a large rubber plantation. Its grandeur and opulence seem to be out of place in the Amazon rainforest. After a tense standoff, the owner of the plantation comes down to greet you. Speaking in a thick Cajun accent, he asks you and your men to stay the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_25;It would be rude to refuse such hospitality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCI_plscometobr_26;As you have dinner with the plantation's owner, you discuss the purpose of your journey. After learning that you intend to bend the knee to the Brazilian Emperor, your host goes silent, before speaking in a stern voice.\n"You want to go to Brazil and bow to their Emperor? You are a fool. We have lived here for generations. The Amazon is our home, and we know its ways well. The Brazilians think that they rule the South, that they rule the Amazon, but they are wrong! Nobody truly rules the Amazon - except the Amazon itself.\nBrazil is being torn asunder by internal tensions. The faith of the natives here in the Amazon is finally taking its rightful place as the faith of Brazil. Perhaps, if the rulers understand the Amazon, they can hold it, but they know that they can never truly be its master.

EVTOPTA_plscometobr_26;I never thought of it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_26;What a load of nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_plscometobr_27;As you turn in for the night, a beautiful woman appears at your door. You had been trading glances with her all throughout dinner, but you never expected anything more. She explains that she is the niece of the plantation's owner, and that she has never left the plantation's grounds in her entire life. She yearns to leave this place, and see what the world is like... and she wants do it while standing at your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_plscometobr_27;We shall sail to Brazil together, my love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bring_cajun_lover_tt;A Cajun lover joins your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dont_bring_cajun_lover_tt;You leave the plantation alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_28;You suddenly find yourself stricken down with a terrible disesase. Your physicians claim that the Amazon's climate has taken its toll on your body, while more superstituous members of your crew whisper about the curse of the Amazon. No matter the cause, you are now sick, and terribly so. You can only hope that your illness passes quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_28;This jungle will kill me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_29;As your journey through the Amazon reaches its final stages, you sight a curious structure off the starboard side of your ship. At a distance it appears to be a normal trading outpost. However, after looking closer, you see decapitated shrunken heads on pikes outside the outpost's entrance. You can also see a figure waving to you from the river's shore, beckoning you to come closer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_29;We should investigate this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_curiosity_killed_cat_tt;Curiosity killed the cat...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_29;This is a bad idea. We should keep moving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_better_left_alone_tt;You leave well enough alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_30;You order your crew to stop in front of the outpost, against the better wishes of your skipper. As you alight from your ship, the figure who was waving rushes forward to greet you. He explains that he was part of a trading mission from the Old World that got shipwrecked off the coast of Brazil, and that he was taken in by a man known as "Leighley". The man then rambles for hours about Leighley, claiming that he is a genius and the only worthy ruler of the entire Amazon rainforest. As this foreigner continues to praise Leighley, you begin to suspect that both of them are stark raving mad. Suddenly, the foreigner abruptly goes silent, and asks you: "Would you like to meet Mister Leighley?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_30;Yes, take me to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_go_quietly_tt;You go to Leighley of your own free will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_30;Um... maybe later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_try_to_leave_tt;You try to leave the outpost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_31;As you try to make your way back to your ship, a group of warriors suddenly emerge from the dense jungle around the outpost and completely surround you. One of their number steps in front of you and says, in a halting voice, "Nobody refuses an invitation from Leighley. You go, or you die." As your eyes scan the group, you can see that every last one of them is holding a weapon of some sort. You realize that their threat is quite serious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_31;My apologies. I will go to him now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_surrender_tt;You surrender to Leighley's warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_31;You'll never take me alive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_escape_attempt_tt;You try to make a break for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_31;Bodyguards! To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_bodyguard_fight_tt;You call your bodyguards to assist you in your escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_plscometobr_32;It was a close shave, but you somehow managed to make it to your boat without so much as a scratch. As you scramble onto your ship, you order your crew to sail away at full speed. Arrows and spears are thrown at your boat as you leave, but none of them strike their target. As you continue to sail down the Amazon, you sigh in relief. That was way too close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_plscometobr_32;As you make a mad dash towards your ship, you are struck by an arrow fired by one of the warriors. Your senses are dulled with excitement, however, and you don't realize the full extent of your injury until you make it back onto your ship. As you lay on the floor in agony, your crew hastily sails the ship back down the Amazon river. You were lucky to escape with your life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_plscometobr_32;You make it back to your ship uninjured, but you can't say the same about your retinue of bodyguards. Most of them lie motionless on the floor, struck down by Leighley's warriors. Those who still live are at the mercy of Leighley now. As you look back on the camp, you can hear the shouts of one of your bodyguards ringing out: "Go on! We just did our jobs!" This moment will haunt you for the rest of your life...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_32;Onwards to Belém.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_33;As you run back towards your ship, you trip over a vine and are rendered helpless in front of Leighley's warriors. The same man who warned you earlier steps forward, apparently deciding whether or not he should execute you on the spot. After a moment, he orders two other warriors to his side and forces you, at spear-point, to walk to Leighley's compound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_33;This was a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
captured_by_kurtz_tt;You fail to escape from Leighley's warriors, and are forced to meet him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_plscometobr_34;As you walk into Leighley's room, you at first believe that he must be away - the room is dimly-lit and appears empty. As you begin to sit down and await his arrival, a deep, raspy voice issues forth from the darkness, startling you back to your feet. "So you are our esteemed visitor from the north. Welcome." A pale and surprisingly overweight man steps forth from the darkness. "It is rare for me to receive visitors of your... stature. I invite you to stay with me for a few days, so we may become acquainted with one another." Unnerved, you consider refusing, but Leighley speaks once more: "I remind you that refusing such gracious hospitality is considered... highly rude. I advise you to accept my offer, while I am still in good spirits.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_plscometobr_34;You are frog-marched into Leighley's room by his loyal band of warriors, and the one who had spoken to you earlier announces: "Here he is. He tried to run." You are highly confused. The room appears to be completely empty. Who is he speaking to? However, your question is soon answered as a man, pale and overweight, steps forth from a dark corner of the room. Although he responds to his native lieutenant, he does not break eye contact with you. "Thank you. You may leave him here with me." The native soldiers leave the room immediately, leaving you alone with Leighley. "I would have liked to meet you under different circumstances, but I do not blame you for running. I will explain why I am here in due course. Until then, however, I invite you to stay here. Do not worry about your ship or your men - I will take care of them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_34;Of course, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_prisoner_tt;You are taken prisoner by Leighley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_35;During the third night of your captivity with Leighley, you are suddenly awoken in the dead of night. He is standing directly over you. "Before I can explain why I am here, I must explain who I once was. I was born a peasant in the port of Miami. I had talents far greater than anyone else I knew - my parents, my peers, even my liege. I sought to rise above my station, so I stole a ship and sailed for Brazil." His voice sounds bitter. "I wanted to find a new world, an ideal world, where a man's place was determined solely by the combination of their talents and hard work. I thought I would find it in Brazil. I nearly killed myself trying to get there. I was a fool. Brazil was no different from Miami. There could only be one way for me to find this new world. I would have to make it myself."\n He leaves your room, just as suddenly and quietly as he had arrived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_35;I should get back to sleep...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
continued_kurtz_prisoner_tt;You remain in captivity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_36;Leighley once again visits you in the night. "I looked to the example set by history. There have been many peasants like me, and they all rose to greatness in the same way. They forged a new world from the landscape around them, using fire and iron. So I sailed down the Amazon and I used my fire and my iron to forge my world. And my might and talents were recognized. I attracted many followers, both from the natives and from further afield. They still think I will lead them in a grand assault on Manaus one day." He pauses. "I have achieved much in my life. I have taught my philosophy to hundreds of people. I am worshiped by them, but I recently realized something else. I will not be here forever. This world I have built... once I die, it too will collapse. And I want my world to die in the same way it was built - on my terms.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_36;What is he saying?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_37;Almost a week into your captivity, you awake with a start. The door to your quarters - usually kept tightly locked - has been left ajar. In the distance, you can hear what sounds like a group of Amazonian warriors celebrating loudly - they appear to be distracted, at least for the time being. You hesitantly walk out of your room to see if you can still escape. As you walk down the dark corridors, you peek into Leighley's room. His door has also been left ajar, and Leighley's silhouette can be observed hunching over a desk. He appears to be writing something, but stops suddenly, puts the quill down, and breathes in. He seems to be aware of your presence, but, for some reason, he is not confronting you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_37;Forget Leighley. I need to leave as soon as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_sneak_out_tt;You leave Leighley to his fate, and try to sneak past his men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_37;This ends now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_confront_tt;You enter Leighley's room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_plscometobr_38;You emerge from the compound to find a large group of Leighley's warriors ritually slaughtering a water buffalo. Slowly and carefully, you weave past their celebration, and find yourself in front of the river. You see your ship moored on the other side, the sailors apparently asleep. How are you supposed to attract their attention? Just after you have this thought, a small rowboat emerges from behind the ship and comes towards you. Your skipper is onboard, and beckons you to come with him. You glance back at the natives, still engaged in their ritual, before climbing aboard the rowboat. Somehow, you managed to escape from Leighley's compound completely unscathed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_38;Onwards to Belém.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_plscometobr_38;You quickly scramble onboard your ship and command it to sail away as quickly as possible. Your crew doesn't need the instruction - as soon as you are safely aboard, they continue down the river. You can still hear the warriors shouting angrily in the distance, but their cries grow more and more distant as you sail away. You have somehow managed to escape not only alive, but completely uninjured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_plscometobr_38;As you run towards your ship, an arrow fired by one of the warriors embeds itself into you, but you push on, ignoring the pain. Once you are safely aboard your ship, you examine the wound more closely. It'll definitely leave a mark, but, considering everything you've been through, it's a small price to pay. As you continue down the river and the cries of the natives grow weaker and weaker, you breathe a sigh of relief. The worst is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_plscometobr_38;Arrows and spears soar past you as you run towards your ship. As you try to climb onboard, you hear a dull, wet sound, and your vision goes black. You come to in your ship's quarters, surrounded by your crew. They inform you that you were seriously injured, but managed to fall over in the right way - into your ship. Leighley's camp is far gone. You managed to escape with your life, but just barely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_escape_successful_tt;You successfully escape from Leighley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_39;You emerge from the compound to find a large group of warriors ritually slaughtering a water buffalo. Slowly and carefully, you try to weave past their celebration, only to end up being spotted by one of the warriors. Their celebration stops immediately, and their exuberant cries of joy change seamlessly into aggressive war chants. In the distance, your ship can be seen maneuvering to your side of the riverbank. There's only one thing you can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_39;Run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kurtz_oh_shit_tt;You make a run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_40;You continue to stare into Leighley's room, expecting him to get up from his chair or say something to you. He does neither. As you slowly step through into the room, you notice a large knife hanging on the wall next to the door. You suddenly realize what you must do, and, automatically, you grab the knife and advance towards Leighley. As you cut him down, you can hear him mutter... something. You aren't sure what. The celebration continues outside as the life slowly fades from Leighley's eyes. You look at his desk, seeing only three things - a quill, an inkpot, and a large, ornate book. Pausing momentarily, you grab Leighley's book before exiting the room.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_40;Goodbye, Leighley.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_41;As you walk outside of the compound, carrying Leighley's bloodstained knife in one hand and his book in your other, you see what the warriors were doing - they were ritually slaughtering a water buffalo. As you step forward into the light, the warriors suddenly stop celebrating, and instead stare at you, transfixed. After a few moments, one of them bows to you, and he is soon followed by the entire rest of the group. You stumble, blindly, towards the shore, and see your ship waiting for you. Silently, without looking back, you climb aboard. Your ship sails onward, yet further into the rainforest. You will be in civilization soon... at least, in a certain sense of the word.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_41;The horror...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_horror_tt;...the horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_BELEM_ARRIVAL;Arrival at Belém;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_42;After a long, dangerous trek through the Amazon rainforest, you finally dock at Belém. As you sail towards the city, you suddenly understand why so many call this city the pearl of the Amazon Delta - after weeks spent in the middle of the jungle, a bustling metropolis like this is a sight for sore eyes. As you ready yourself for the journey ahead, you reflect on your recent travels. You successfully braved the mighty Amazon, and are now just a short voyage away from Rio de Janeiro.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_42;Let's not waste any time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_BR_TRIP_ATLANTIC;Across the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_44;As the days drag on, I find myself thinking back to [Root.Capital.Capital.GetName], wondering what is happening in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding].

EVTOPTA_plscometobr_45_A;Aw... I do remember that...!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_45_B;I hope we will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_46;Today is an unusually calm day on the South Atlantic. You are just beginning to get bored when a lookout on your top mast spots an incoming ship. At first, you think nothing of it - it's probably just a passing merchant ship, or perhaps it's carrying someone of importance from Brazil. However, as it grows closer, you notice two very important things: they are flying a black flag and appear to be firing at your ship. You are being attacked by pirates!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_46;Everyone, to arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_plscometobr_47;You have been at sea for a while now, and your food supplies are running thin. You have been eating nothing but hardtack for days on end. Some of your crew members warn that this may be bad for your health, but what else are you to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_47;Once I'm off this boat, I'll never eat hardtack again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_48;As you stand on the deck of your ship and survey the endless sea, you notice something odd in the distance. Looking closely, it appears to be a gigantic dorsal fin, and it's headed straight for your ship. Before you can say anything, your lookout raises the alarm: "Shark! Shark! Dead ahead! All hands on deck!" The fin's owner collides with your ship, sending one man overboard. The sea is stained red with his blood...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_48;Kill the beast before it does any more damage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_plscometobr_49;In recent days, you have seen dark storm clouds gathering on the horizon, stretching in each direction as far as the eye can see. Your men battened down the hatches and prepared themselves for the coming storm, but nothing could prepare you for it. The storm howls and rages without end, and the waves grow higher and higher...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_49;All hands on deck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_plscometobr_50;As your ship continues its voyage to Rio, your lookout announces something startling. "There is a man hanging to a piece of driftwood towards port!" You and your men quickly assemble along the deck to see if what the lookout says is true. Sure enough, in the distance, you can see a dark mass. One of your men turns to you and asks, "What are your orders?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_15;What? We aren't going to pick him up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_15;Bring him aboard, we'll leave him at Rio.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_BRASIL_ARRIVAL;The Empire of Brazil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_51;Our company has finally reached the great capital of [offmap_china.GetFullName] - Rio de Janeiro. This is by far the grandest imperial capital you have ever seen. The sky is clear, the streets are clean, and the people are friendly. If you didn't know better, you could almost believe that this place had escaped the Event entirely. Surely, the city's character has been like this since time immemorial...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_plscometobr_55;I'm out on a walk in a beautiful park in the August Empire when I spot two groups of people running across a nearby field and kicking a ball around. As you look further, you they are playing Futebol! Brazilians are said to be the best in the world at this game, but these players look decidedly amateur...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_55;I can see an opening in their defense...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_55;'How do you play this game?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_plscometobr_55;I'll just enjoy the park instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_plscometobr_56;Having reached the glorious capital of the [offmap_china.GetFullName], it only takes a few days before a group of ministers approach me, offering to read and discuss the writings of José Bonifácio de Andrada. He was the most prominent advisor of the first Emperor, and was the tutor of the legendary Pedro II of Brazil. They think I, as a ruler, will be particularly interested by his works on politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_56;Of course! I would love to hear more about your political philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_plscometobr_56_TT;The ministers are impressed by your enthusiasm.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_plscometobr_56_TT;Ah, I know Bonifácio from his poetry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_plscometobr_57;My guards and I have been making our way through a bustling market this morning. There is ample supply of every meat and game, and trinkets and baubles abound...!

EVTOPTA_plscometobr_57;Mmmh, what is that smell...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

china_stable_desc;The [Root.GetName] is experiencing a period of internal stability, and trade with the South is profitable. Without any large-scale disasters or powerful enemies prosperity is able to spread, and the military might of Brazil stands ready to defend both its own wealth and its loyal tributaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_unrest_desc;Civil unrest runs rampant in the [Root.GetName], and it has thrown the trade routes with the South into disarray. Brazil's armies are occupied internally in an attempt to keep the peace, and unless the unrest is quelled soon a full-blown civil war may well erupt at any moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_civil_war_desc;Civil war has erupted in the [Root.GetName], and trade with the South suffers as a result. The Empire's armies are arrayed against one another, and the ruling dynasty itself is threatened. Intrepid generals may well seek their fortune in the North, beyond Brazil's borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_plague_desc;A terrible disease wracks the [Root.GetName], leaving thousands lying dead in its wake. Trade has ground to a halt as the Brazilian economy has been forced to its knees, and even the Empire's armies have been decimated to but a shadow of their former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_golden_age_desc;The [Root.GetName] has reached untold power and wealth. As Brazil flourishes, the trade routes with the South bring not only valuable goods in previously unheard-of quantities, but also rich and abundant examples of Brazilian culture. An Emperor of Brazil in this Golden Age may well rightfully consider [Root.Ruler.GetHerselfHimself] the [Root.Ruler.GetMasterMistress] of the Americas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_open_desc;Brazil is currently open to trade and interested in acquiring friends and tributaries within its sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

china_expansionist_desc;The Emperor is showing a rare interest in the rest of the world. Brazil might aggressively seek to gain new Tributary states, or even stage a major invasion to 'pacify the North'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_mongol_invasion;Being Invaded by the Amazonians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_mongol_invasion_desc;The Amazonian warbands of the north pour into Brazil. The mighty Brazilian armies are occupied with their desperate defense of the Empire, and the fighting has greatly disrupted trade as well as caused a mass exodus of refugees. Scions of the current dynasty may well flee northward via sea routes if the war goes poorly enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_jurchen_invasion;Being Invaded by Gaúchos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_jurchen_invasion_desc;An enormous horde of Gaúcho horse warriors has descended upon Brazil from the cold and unforgiving far South. The mighty Brazilian armies are preoccupied with a desperate defense against the fierce invaders. The war is disrupting trade along the Coffee Current and could cause a mass exodus of refugees. Should the Gaúchos triumph, it is possible that scions of the current Dynasty may flee northward with the remnants of their forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brasil_religious_civil_war_candomble;Candomble Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brasil_religious_civil_war_candomble_desc;A religious uprising has erupted in the [Root.GetName], and trade with the South suffers as a result. The entire Northeast has risen against Imperial rule, and the ruling dynasty is in danger. Interpid generals may well seek their fortune in the North, beyond Brazil's borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brasil_religious_civil_war_charismatic;Charismatic Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brasil_religious_civil_war_candomble_desc;A religious uprising has erupted in the [Root.GetName], and trade with the South suffers as a result. The entire country has been thrown into sectarian chaos, and the ruling dynasty is in danger. Interpid generals may well seek their fortune in the North, beyond Brazil's borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
china_famine_desc;A disastrous harvest has caused Brazilian agriculture to buckle under the population. The calamity has caused most trade to cease, and even as their numbers dwindle, the [offmap_china.GetName]'s once-mighty armies have been burdened with relief efforts for the suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
