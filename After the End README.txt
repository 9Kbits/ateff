AFTER THE END
A post-apocalyptic North America mod for Crusader Kings II
Version 0.1.1


	INSTALLATION
1. Download "After the End.zip".
2. Unzip everything to to My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Windows) or Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Mac). If the "mod" folder does not exist, you should create it.
3. Open Crusader Kings II and check "After the End" in the "Mods" section of the launcher.


	AFRICAN PORTRAITS
If you do not have the African Portraits DLC, the faces of Tuskegean and Caribbean characters will not appear. In order to fix this, open the mod's "interface" folder and remove "portraits_african.gfx".


	FUTURE PLANS
- Covering the entire map
- A Congress/Parliament system, where monarchs give up some control of their kingdom in exchange for a lower risk of vassal rebellion
- Additional scenarios
