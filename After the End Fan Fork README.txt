Compatible with CK2 2.8.1 beta and the Jade Dragon DLC


	INSTALLATION
1. Delete any previous versions of this mod.
2. Download "After the End Fan Fork.zip".
3. Unzip everything to to My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Windows) or Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Mac). If the "mod" folder does not exist, you should create it.
4. Open Crusader Kings II and check "After the End Fan Fork" in the "Mods" section of the launcher.
5. If you have Sunset Invasion, enable it and the "After the End Fan Fork - Sunset Invasion DLC" mod. This will not cause an Aztec invasion, but it will allow Native American faces to show properly.
6. Similarly, if you have African Portraits, enable it and the "After the End Fan Fork - African Faces DLC" mod.
7. The "After the End Fan Fork - Mongol Faces DLC" works on the same principle.
