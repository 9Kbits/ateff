AFTER THE END FAN FORK
A fan-made fork of the original post-apocalyptic North America mod for Crusader Kings II
Version 0.5 (Forked off from After the End v0.9)
Compatible with CK2 3.2.1 and the Holy Fury DLC

	INSTALLATION
1. Delete any previous versions of this mod.
2. Download "After the End Fan Fork.zip".
3. Unzip everything to to My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Windows) or Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod (Mac). If the "mod" folder does not exist, you should create it.
4. Open Crusader Kings II and check "After the End Fan Fork" in the "Mods" section of the launcher.
5. If you have Sunset Invasion, enable it and the "After the End Fan Fork - Sunset Invasion DLC" mod. This will not cause an Aztec invasion, but it will allow Native American faces to show properly.
6. Similarly, if you have African Portraits, enable it and the "After the End Fan Fork - African Faces DLC" mod.
7. All of the other included portrait submods operate on similar principles. English and German Faces requires Monks and Mystics, while Chinese Faces requires Jade Dragon. The others should be easy enough to guess.
